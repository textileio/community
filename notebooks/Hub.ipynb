        "# The Hub\n",
        "\n",
        "## Threads Services\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads Services (e.g. pinning encrypted data on IPFS and helping multiple peers relay updates across the network) can be built and deployed to the network using [go-threads](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads). Textile offers a number of these functions through [The Hub](), which can help developers scale their applications on IPFS. Attaching the Hub to your databases will allow developers to deliver high-quality user-experiences. In order to make this as straightforward as possible, developers looking to leverage the remote Hub need to understand a few additional basic concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### API Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "The Hub APIs are available for your apps and your app users. You can use the Hub APIs with a privileged [Account API Key]() or with a [User Key](). Both have the ability to push new data to a ThreadsDB, and relay ThreadsDB updates (among other things).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Account Key\n",
        "\n",
        "Account keys provide direct access to developer and org account Buckets and Threads. Account keys make it possible to build apps that have full access to developer or organization Buckets. You can use account keys to integrate your Buckets into CI, dashboards, team messaging integration, etc. To create a new Account Key use `tt key create` and select the `account` option.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### User Key\n",
        "\n",
        "User keys provide existing external identities (users) access to their own threads, under the custodianship of the parent (developer) account. Apps can persist and replicate ThreadsDB data for users. A single user key can be added to your app to authenticate many users to your Hub resources. To create a new User Key use `tt key create` and select the `user` option.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Ownership\n",
        "\n",
        "The databases you create over the APIs are owned in one of three ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Developer owned. If you use an account key with the Buckets or ThreadsDB APIs, the data will be linked directly to your account.\n",
        "2. Org owned. If you create an account key using the --org flag, the Buckets and Threads will be linked to the organization.\n",
        "3. User owned. If you create a user key, Textile allows your app to provision new Buckets and Threads on behalf of your users. This data will be signed and owned by your end-users and only accessible to them. \n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can specify the *context* to customize exactly *how* resources (e.g., storage, networking, etc) are used/allocated within their own apps, and which of the three above ownership strategies are applied. This Conext API allows a developer to shift what role they are using to access the remote Hub APIs. This is interesting because a developer is able to access Hub resources as themselves (i.e., the developer), with all the administrative capabilities that entails, or as users of their app, which are sandboxed but able to create Threads (and Buckets) of their own *within* that user-scoped sandbox.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a very powerful framework for accessing and allocating developer resources on behalf of users, while still providing the control and quality user-experience that apps built on Threads should provide.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Identity\n",
        "\n",
        "Related to dadta ownership is the concept of identity. Textile's Hub and Buckets/ThreadsDB APIs are flexible when it comes to user identity, allowing you to handle user identities (for access control and security/encryption) in the best way for your app and your users. In order to handle *multiple* peers collaborating on a single database, as well as the ability to handle storage *on behalf* of a user, Hub APIs expect a simple Identity interface for singing and validating updates."

This is a simple [public key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) inspired interface that similarly requires the implementer to be capable of returning an associated public key for verification. In many cases, the Identity will just be a private key, but callers can use any setup that suits their needs. A default implementation based on [Libp2p's crypto library]() is provided for convinience (and is also used by default if no identity is provided), however, many developers will want to use alternative identity provides, such as [3box/Ceramic](), [Fortmatic](), and existing private/public keypair, or a web3 provider such as [Metamask](). Textile Hub also provides email-based identities.\n",
