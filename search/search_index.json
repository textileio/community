However, unlike traditional cloud services, buckets are built on open, decentralized protocols including the IPFS and Libp2p. You can serve websites, data, and apps from buckets. Buckets are packed with useful features: Explore your Buckets on the Hub gateway . Render web content in your Bucket on a persistent website . Automatically distribute your updates on IPFS using IPNS . Collaboratively manage Buckets as an organization . Create private Buckets where your app users can store data . (Soon) Archive Bucket data on Filecoin to ensure long-term security and access to your files. Initialize a Bucket \u00b6 To start a Bucket in your current working directory, you must first initialize it. You can initialize a bucket with an existing UnixFS DAG, available in the IPFS network, or import it interactively in an existing bucket. When working on your local machine, buckets are mapped to working directories. Once you initialize a bucket in a directory, anytime you return to the directory, the Textile CLI will automatically detect the Bucket you're interacting with. Read CLI docs for buckets . Info Bucket names are unique to a developer and within an Org. They're not globally unique. Warning Be careful about creating a bucket in a root directory because all children directories become linked to that bucket. To move or remove a bucket's link to a directory, edit, move or delete the .textile/config.yml file (it will be a hidden folder in the bucket's directory) Shared buckets \u00b6 You can create buckets to share with all members of an organization. To do so, simply initialize an Org first and then initialize a Bucket using the HUB_ORG environmental flag, by specifying the name of the Org you want to share the bucket with. For example, HUB_ORG=astronauts hub bucket init . All members of the Org will be able to push and pull files to and from the shared Bucket. Read more about creating Orgs . Info To check which org a bucket is registered with, examine the .textile/config.yml file (it will be a hidden folder in the bucket's directory). Encrypted buckets \u00b6 It's possible to create encrypted buckets. The contents of encrypted buckets will still exist on IPFS but the contents will be obfuscated to any viewer that doesn't have access to the encryption keys. You can choose to create encrypted buckets when creating them in the CLI or when initializing them in the JavaScript library . Publishing content \u00b6 Push new files \u00b6 View the Bucket push CLI docs . hub bucket push Diffing and Syncing \u00b6 When a bucket is pushed to the remote API (the Hub): Its Merkle DAG representation is saved locally as a reference of the latest pushed version. When you execute hub buck status , it compares the persisted Merkle DAG with a generated Merkle DAG of the Bucket local state. Walking both DAGs and comparing CIDs can quickly provide paths that changed to the last known version. In a nutshell, when a bucket is pushed, the persisted Merkle DAG contains the minimum amount of information about the directory structure and data fingerprints. Read more about this process . Encryption \u00b6 You can encrypt bucket contents by opting-in to the option when you create your bucket. The encryption setup is based on AES-CTR + AES-512 HMAC as seen here . This is a modified version of the encryption library Google Drive uses to handle large streams (files). Encrypted buckets have a couple of goals: Obfuscate bucket data/files (the normal goal of encryption). Obfuscate directory structure, which means encrypting IPLD nodes and their links. The AES and HMAC keys used for bucket encryption are stored in the ThreadDB collection instance. That means each bucket has a model entry as a key. This setup allows for bucket access to be inherited by thread ACL rules. This also means that if you can break into the thread, and you gain access to the thread read key, you can decrypt the bucket content. As a compromise, we've added some convenience methods to the local buck client which allows you to encrypt content locally (protected by a password) before it gets added to the bucket. This has the downside that you must remember the password. Finally, you can run the standalone buckets daemon buckd locally and use a remote peer as a thread replicator (no read key access). This means that there\u2019s no downside to the keys being stored in the bucket collection instance. Password-based encryption uses the same approach but also leverages scrypt to derive the keys from the password. This carries the normal tradeoff: The encryption is only as good as the password. Retrieving content \u00b6 Pull files \u00b6 hub bucket init --existing Info Use the --existing flag to list buckets already pushed by you. Use HUB_ORG to list buckets already pushed by your collaborators. Explore on the gateway \u00b6 To inspect your pushed files, explore on the gateway: hub bucket links then open the first result 'Thread links' in your browser. The Hub gateway gives you a static URL where you can explore, download, and share your latest Bucket content. Render on a website \u00b6 If your Bucket contains web content, the Bucket website endpoint will provide you a static URL that'll always render the latest content from your Bucket. See HTTP Domains . Render on IPFS gateways \u00b6 Buckets are dynamic folders distributed over IPFS using ThreadDB. Each time you create a new Bucket, you'll receive a new IPNS Address that you can use on the IPFS address to fetch the latest Bucket content. The IPNS address will not change but the content will update each time you push changes to your Bucket. Each time you update your Bucket, you'll receive a new IPFS address to fetch that version of your Bucket content. HTTP Domain \u00b6 All public Buckets are automatically provided a subdomain on textile.space that reflects the latest changes in your Bucket. Your Bucket's IPNS address is used as the subdomain, such that your Bucket URL will always be: <ipns-address>.textile.space . This is designed to enhance the interoperability of protocols using Textile Buckets. IPNS Address \u00b6 Each Bucket has a unique IPNS address that allows you to render or fetch your Bucket on any IPFS peer or gateway that supports IPNS, including ipfs.io and Cloudflare . Buckets can't change the speed of IPNS propagation through the network but we recommend you explore and try for yourself. The Hub gateway will always render the latest data right away. Bucket Automation (CI/CD) \u00b6 Buckets are an ideal tool for persisting your website, source code, or documentation on IPFS using continuous integration. Tools like Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions make this easy. We've provided a configurable GitHub Action that allows you to: Push or update your Bucket based on pull requests, commits, and merges. Generate IPNS, IPFS, and HTTP addresses for every Bucket creation or update. Create temporary Buckets for staging or review that can be removed automatically when content is merged or pull requests are closed. Example output from Textile Bucket GitHub Action Cross Protocol Support \u00b6 Buckets are designed to be interoperable across protocols and services. Here are a few examples. Buckets and Threads \u00b6 Buckets are built on ThreadDB . In fact, in their most basic form, Buckets are just a document in a Thread that is updated each time the directory of data is updated. Since buckets run on Threads, it opens the door to many new integrations that can be built on Buckets! Buckets and HTTP \u00b6 Buckets can be rendered over HTTP through either the Hub Gateway , the Bucket subdomains , or on any IPFS gateway supporting IPNS (see below). Buckets and IPFS \u00b6 Data in a Bucket is stored as IPLD and pinned on IPFS. You can use the underlying content addresses to pin new Bucket content on additional pinning services such as Pinata or Infura . This can be useful if you want additional replication of your content on the IPFS network. Buckets and IPNS \u00b6 Every Bucket you create has a unique ID associated with it. The Bucket ID is an IPNS address that you can use to fetch the latest Bucket content from any IPFS peer or view it over IPFS gateways that support the IPNS protocol.

If you prefer, you can still type bucket . mkdir launchpad cd launchpad HUB_ORG = nasa hub buck init You've now created a new Bucket inside of the launchpad directory and owned by your nasa organization. Invite a new org member \u00b6 hub org invite The final step is to invite collaborators to your Org. Once they accept the invite, they'll be able to interact with buckets associated with the Org. App user Buckets \u00b6 If you're building an app using one of our developer libraries , you can use buckets from inside your apps. Apps generally will create buckets on behalf of each user, meaning the user should retain control of the Bucket metadata and contents. Bucket Access Roles \u00b6 Buckets can be shared in more ways than organizations. Multi-writer buckets leverage the distributed nature of ThreadDB by allowing multiple identities to write to the same buckets that are hosted by different Libp2p hosts. Since buckets are ThreadDB collection instances, this is no different than normal ThreadDB peer collaboration. Path access \u00b6 Read and write access roles are defined in a bucket at any path. Any subpaths automatically inherit the permissions of their parent. For example, granting read access to your bucket at / would also grant read access to a file that exists at /path/to/foo.jpg . You can set different access rules within the same bucket by using a combination of paths and specified roles at the path. Role types \u00b6 Admin Users with the ability to modify permissions. Writer Users allowed update data at the specified path. Reader Users allowed read data at the specified path. Unspecified Users with any permissions specified path. Authorizing users \u00b6 You can specify new users and their roles by inserting their public key into the bucket access rules. Let's take a look at how we update roles using the CLI. hub buck roles grant -r writer \\ bbaareicookqfgeosr225wwdknmpmvgemydxolzxesu6woxghpulxvizose /path/to Success IDENTITY ROLE * Reader bbaareicookqfgeosr225wwdknmpmvgemydxolzxesu6woxghpulxvizose Writer bbaareieyrq92sbfcx2bhbmsfxzj25pi7ldx2vkrtcn6hu3xzi4mpzwqvcy Admin > Success!

You'll see four different options - buckd , buck , hubd , and hub . hub is the option you need. It provides all the functionality you'll need to interact with the Textile Hub and Buckets. You'll also see different operating systems. Select the one that matches your computer. Next, follow the installation instructions based on your operating system. Mac Installation \u00b6 Open the contents of the downloaded archive and run the install script. This should install the hub tool on your computer. You can verify with `hub --help Run the hub install script. On MacOS you will need to confirm that it is okay to run the hub binary before it runs successfully. You will see this warning: Select 'Cancel' Select 'Cancel.' Go to 'System Settings' => 'General' where you will be able to click, 'Allow Anyway.' System Settings Run hub --help again and this time select, 'Open` when prompted. Select 'Open` when prompted. You will now be able to continue using the CLI without issue. When you update the binary, you may need to repeat the above steps. We will add developer signing to our MacOS binaries soon. Successfully running hub --help to print out the command docs. Windows Installation \u00b6 The Windows Hub CLI binary comes with a hub.exe that runs hub commands. You can use Powershell to work with the hub CLI by running the executable directly in your terminal like below. Running hub --help in Powershell. This method requires you to work in the same directory as hub.exe . Another option is to add hub.exe to the PATH environment variable to access the hub command globally. Adding hub.exe to the Path Environment Variable \u00b6 Rename the directory and place it in an accessible location like the C:\\ directory.

To use any of these APIs, you need to use API keys. Read Google's API key best practices for an overview of how API keys will be used here. This section will cover the overview of the three APIs and how to work with the API keys. A Tour of Available APIs \u00b6 Buckets \u00b6 Buckets provide S3-like data storage on IPFS. Just as you can create Buckets with the Hub CLI , you can create Buckets using JavaScript with js-textile . The js-textile library allows you to create and edit Buckets owned by you or your organization using an account key . Alternatively, you can use Buckets to store your user's data using a user group key . ThreadDB \u00b6 ThreadDB is a mongo-like database that runs on IPFS. You can use js-textile to connect to the Hub's hosted thread server ( Client ) to push and persist encrypted data on an IPFS-backed database. Alternatively, you can embed local, p2p databases in your app that use remote IPFS peers for pinning and remote ThreadDB peers to relay updates ( Database ). Mailboxes \u00b6 The Users API provides tools for sending and receiving messages between Hub users. Mailboxes are built on ThreadDB. Hub mailboxes are a unique inboxing and messaging system designed for modern apps where users hold private keys linked to their identity. With just their private and public key, a user can send and receive encrypted messages to other users in your app. API Access \u00b6 You can access the Hub APIs through the use of API keys. API Keys \u00b6 The Hub has two forms of an API key, an Account Key and a User Group Key . Account Keys \u00b6 Account keys grant access to the developer's resources (e.g. Buckets you create using the command-line interface). If Account Keys are generated with the -o (organization) flag, they will grant access to that organization's resources. Example uses include, integrating your Buckets into CI, dashboards, team messaging integration, etc. User Group Keys \u00b6 User group keys only grant access to new resources for new identities, not those of the developer. User group keys can be used in an application to allow app users to leverage Hub APIs (e.g. create and push new buckets). User group keys do not have permission to access the developer or organization resources, but threads and buckets created using these keys are counted against API limits . Key Use and Security \u00b6 API keys are project-centric credentials that you can use to provision your Hub resources to end-users (either within your organization or in a public app). We recommend reading this thorough overview of API key design and best practices . Access Summary \u00b6 Below is a summary of the Hub resources you may create and access with each key type.

We'll break the discussion into a few key parts, shown in the table of contents to the right. Available APIs \u00b6 Buckets \u00b6 Buckets provide S3-like data storage on IPFS. Just as you can create Buckets with the Hub CLI , you can create Buckets using JavaScript with js-textile . The js-textile library allows you to create and edit Buckets owned by you or your organization using an account key . Alternatively, you can use Buckets to store your user's data using a user group key . ThreadDB \u00b6 ThreadDB is a mongo-like database that runs on IPFS. You can use it in combination with js-textile to add replication and relay to your user's databases. When combined, js-threads and js-textile allow you to embed private, p2p databases in your app that use remote IPFS peers for pinning and remote ThreadDB peers to relay updates to all parties. This configuration will help you scale your app and offer the highest quality experience to your users. API Access \u00b6 When building apps or services, you can access the Hub APIs to push new buckets, relay or persist threads, ensure data from your app is available on the IPFS network, and more. You can access those APIs through the use of API keys. Roles \u00b6 There are only three roles on the Hub, the developer, a developer's orgs, and the user. Developers : You. You are a primary account owner. You can create new API keys, create and join new Organizations, and access admin APIs. You can create your own Buckets and Threads. You can use the CLI with your account do all the mentioned. Organizations : You and your collaborators. Members can share admin control of API keys. Members can share access to and synchronize Bucket state across all members. Referenced through docs as simply, Org . Users : Accounts generated by your apps using a User Group API key. Your app can create Threads and Buckets owned by these users. These users can then add or remove content from those assets based on their identity. They cannot use the CLI and cannot create new API keys. API Keys \u00b6 The Hub has two forms of API key, an Account Key and a User Group Key . Account Keys can grant access to the developers own resources (e.g. Buckets you create using the command-line interface). If Account Keys are generated with the -o (organization) flag, they will grant access to that organization's resources. Example uses include, integrating your Buckets into CI, dashboards, team messaging integration, etc. User Group Keys only grant access to new resources for new identities, not those of the developer. User group keys can be used in an application to allow app users to leverage Hub APIs (e.g. create and push new buckets). User group keys do not have permission to access the developer or organization resources, but threads and buckets created using these keys are counted against API limits . Access Summary \u00b6 Below is a brief summary of the Hub resources you may create and access with each key type. Resource example Owner CLI Required Key Developer Threads Hub Developer create, access Account Key Developer Buckets Hub Developer create, access Account Key Organization Threads Hub Developer(s) create, access Account Key Organization Buckets Hub Developer(s) create, access Account Key User Threads App User User Group Key User Buckets App User User Group Key Creating Keys \u00b6 Account Key \u00b6 To create a new Account Key using hub key create and selecting the account option. See CLI options User Group Key \u00b6 To create a new user group key using hub key create and selecting the user group option. If you are building an app in an organization, use HUB_ORG=<org name> hub key create to link a new key to the organization not your personal account. There is currently no migration tools, so we recommend creating a new organization or using an existing organization when starting a new app (see Organizations ). \u279c hub key create # select the 'user' option \u2714 user KEY SECRET TYPE bqab5csdh...no6jjezox4 bm2tk476yivwlw...3a4cayll7ztha user > Success! Created new API key and secret Non-signing User Group keys \u00b6 You can use insecure keys with the API by creating non-signing keys. These keys are meant to use during development only. Read the tutorial on development mode to use these keys. Updating User Group keys \u00b6 You can replace your keys in your app at any time and the user will still have access to their Threads and Buckets as long as the key is connected to the same developer or organization. See CLI commands Identity and API access \u00b6 Generic identity model \u00b6 Identities also provide a way for developers to allocate resources (i.e., storage) for a particular user, and in fact, is a key component in ensuring that a user controls their own data . Hub, Buckets, and ThreadDB APIs are flexible when it comes to user identity, allowing you to handle user identities (for access control and security/encryption) in the best way for your app and your users. In order to handle multiple peers collaborating on a single database, as well as the ability to handle storage on behalf of a user, Hub APIs expect a simple Identity interface for singing and validating updates. You can create a basic identity for our user in a JavaScript application using the PrivateKey object available in the Hub library. In practice, you might have your own identity provider, or you might want to use a hierarchical key/wallet or mnemonic phrase to help store a users keys for them. Whatever you decide, Textile's generic identity interface should be able to support it. import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' async function example () { const identity = await PrivateKey . fromRandom () // Random identity return identity } Read more about Identity in the identity tutorial . Data Ownership \u00b6 The databases and buckets you create over the APIs are owned in one of three ways. Developer owned. If you use an account key with the Buckets or ThreadDB APIs, the data will be linked directly to your account. Org owned. If you create an account key using the HUB_ORG environmental variable, the Buckets and Threads will be linked to the organization. User owned. If you create a user group key, Textile allows your app to provision new Buckets and Threads on behalf of your users. This data will be signed and owned by your end-users and only accessible to them. API keys add a lot of flexibility in how you use resources on the Hub. A developer is able to access Hub resources as themselves (i.e., the developer), with all the administrative capabilities that entails, or as users of their app, which are sandboxed but can create Threads (and Buckets) of their own within that user-scoped sandbox. This is a very powerful framework for accessing and allocating developer resources on behalf of users, while still providing the control and quality user-experience that apps built on Threads should provide. User authorization \u00b6 This step is only necessary if you are using production (signing required) API keys. If you are in development mode , you don't need to do this step. Authorizing the user with your user group key and Secret will allow the user to store threads and buckets using your developer resources on the Hub. If you are running in development mode and created a key that doesn't require signing. Read more about setting up authentication and authorization in production mode . Libraries \u00b6 You can find all remote Thread and Bucket APIs in the textile libraries below. These libraries are meant to work in combination with the threads libraries when you want to create and manage Threads database in your app. Here are the libraries you will find useful to start building today.

You can use the CLI with your account do all the mentioned. Organizations : You and your collaborators. Members can share admin control of API keys. Members can share access to and synchronize Bucket state across all members. Referenced through docs as simply, Org . Users : Accounts generated by your apps using a User Group API key.

It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.

We may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Textile Site (including, the release of new tools and resources).

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver \u00b6 PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. 13.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim, or controversy (\"Claim\") relating in any way to this Agreement, the Textile Site, your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Textile will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 13, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \"Rules\") as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator's award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a California state court located in San Francisco County, California. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If a claim proceeds in court for any reason rather than in arbitration, we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. 13.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. 13.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Suite 100, 100 Shoreline Hwy, Bldg B, Mill Valley, CA 94941, United States and via email at contact@textile.io , with subject line TEXTILE LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Services, otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we will also not be bound by them. 14. Publicity. \u00b6 We're proud to have you as a customer. During the term of this agreement, you hereby grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable and sublicensable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos for the purpose of identifying you as a Textile customer to promote and market our services. But if you prefer we not use your logo or name in a particular way, just let us know, and we will respect that. 15. Miscellaneous. \u00b6 15.1 Assignment. You will not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 14.1 will be void. We may assign this Agreement without your consent (a) in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (b) to any Affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for Textile as a party to this Agreement and Textile is fully released from all of its obligations and duties to perform under this Agreement.

If the terms of this document are inconsistent with the terms contained in any Policy, the terms contained in this document will control. 15.3 Force Majeure. Neither party nor their respective affiliates will be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond such party's reasonable control, including acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or other telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war. 15.4 Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to conflict of law rules. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. 15.5 Trade Compliance. In addition to the representation and warranty above, in connection with this Agreement, you will comply with all applicable import, re-import, sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and re-export control laws and regulations, including all such laws and regulations that apply to a U.S. company, such as the Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Specifically, you agree that you shall not \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 sell, export, re-export, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from us under the Agreement to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations. For clarity, you are solely responsible for compliance related to the manner in which you choose to use the Service Offerings, including your transfer and processing of Your Content, the provision of Your Content to End Users, and the region in which any of the foregoing occur. 15.6 Independent Contractors; Non-Exclusive Rights. We and you are independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship. Neither party, nor any of their respective affiliates, is an agent of the other for any purpose or has the authority to bind the other. Both parties reserve the right (a) to develop or have developed for it products, services, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, services, concepts, systems, or techniques developed or contemplated by the other party, and (b) to assist third party developers or systems integrators who may offer products or services which compete with the other party's products or services. 15.7 Language. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to this Agreement must be in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the English language version of the Agreement will control if there is any conflict. 15.8 Confidentiality and Publicity. Each party may use Confidential Information only in connection with its use or provision, as applicable, of the Service Offerings as permitted under this Agreement. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information during the Term or at any time during the 5-year period following the end of the Term. Each party will take all reasonable measures to avoid disclosure, dissemination or unauthorized use of Confidential Information, including, at a minimum, those measures the Disclosing Party take to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. Neither party will issue any press release nor make any other public communication with respect to this Agreement or its use or provision, as applicable, of the Service Offerings in connection with this Agreement. 15.9 Notice.

The Service Offerings are provided to the U.S. Government as \"commercial items,\" \"commercial computer software,\" \"commercial computer software documentation,\" and \"technical data\" with the same rights and restrictions generally applicable to the Service Offerings.

Any dispute, claim, or controversy (\"Claim\") relating in any way to this Agreement, the Textile Site, your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Textile will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 13, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \"Rules\") as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator's award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a California state court located in San Francisco County, California. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If a claim proceeds in court for any reason rather than in arbitration, we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. 13.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. 13.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Suite 100, 100 Shoreline Hwy, Bldg B, Mill Valley, CA 94941, United States and via email at contact@textile.io , with subject line TEXTILE LEGAL OPT OUT.

By using the Powergate to persist your data on Filecoin, you gain access to rich storage configuration options such as: Replication factor Miner selection Deal renewal Repair Configurable storage is provided through a connected IPFS peer or pinning network. Warning Do not run the Powergate in production systems and please join the powergate-users channel in the Filecoin community Slack for announcements and support. The Powergate will remain in rapid development until a formal release. During this time, you're likely to encounter bugs and unannounced API changes. Overview \u00b6 Powergate is a collection of libraries, modules, and configuration options, that can be used independently or together, to integrate Filecoin in your application or storage system. It is designed to manage one or many Filecoin wallet addresses, and each address and its associated configuration and data storage is scoped by user. Most Powergate APIs function within the context of single user. Some benefits of using the Powergate include: Ensure storing data on Filecoin is easily available on the IPFS network. Handle long-term storage deal management, including automated renewal and repair. Make use of network indices to improve miner selection and deal creation. Manage Filecoin wallet addresses for one or many users. Easily configure, connect, and deploy Powergate, Lotus , and IPFS together. Much more!

Why is my custom StorageConfig being ignored? \u00b6 In SR2, we're using a custom miner-selector strategy by default: SR2-MinerSelector. Every time Powergate needs to create a deal, it fetches this JSON file and takes amount miners at random from each region and make deals with them. The list from the JSON file includes miners who should be reasonably reliable to increase the odds of a successful deal. The list is maintained by the Slingshot team. Powergate fetches this file every time it needs to do a deal so it will always select the most recent miners. If you set TrustedMiners or RepFactor in your storage config, those will be ignored by Powergate. If you want full control using your StorageConfig , you can run powd with --ffsminerselector=\"reputation\" (or env POWD_FFSMINERSELECTOR) which switches to the previous unopinionated miner selector strategy used before SR2. I see a log error miner XXX not in ask-cache and query-ask errored: , what does this mean? \u00b6 This usually means two possible problems: The targeted miners don't exist in the network, or your Lotus node is not completely synced. Your Lotus node doesn't have connectivity with them to query ask their storage price. In most cases, if the miner or your Lotus node are in China, there might be reachability challenges related to the second bullet point. If you're not using any custom config and just the SR2 miner selector using the remote JSON file, and experiencing problems reaching some of those miners, please report this in a support channel since we should understand why that particular miner might have problems for your Lotus node. When I start Powergate, I see a fatal error: verifying sr2 url content: getting miners list from url: Get https://xxxxx , what does this mean? \u00b6 Since Powergate uses SR2 miner selection by default, it checks if the miners JSON file is reachable. This file is located in Github so it should be readily available. Some Powergate community members running Powergate from China had experienced these exact problems since there might be constraints in fetching this file from Github. You can override this URL by specifying the flag/env --ffsminerselectorparams / POWD_FFSMINERSELECTORPARAMS with any URL that might be reachable from your location. I see a log error computing commP failed: generating CommP: blockstore: block not found , what does this mean? \u00b6 This is a sign that your Lotus node is not properly configured to use go-ipfs from Powergate as the underlying blockstore to find and store data. You should configure the following in your Lotus config.toml file: [Client] UseIpfs = true IpfsMAddr = \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001\" IpfsUseForRetrieval = true Note that if you are running the Powergate stack with make up , this is already wired automatically . The pow data log commands mention an error ... adding markets funds failed: , how can I fix this? \u00b6 You should check that your user wallet address used for making deals has enough funds. What does the following log error mean: rpc go-jsonrpc: xxxx ? \u00b6 Usually, this is related to a reported issue. As a solution, Powergate switched to another style of connecting to Lotus which is more reliable and avoids that problem. You could ignore those errors since Powergate is not relying on the Lotus client to have stable connections. If the errors don't impact other logs related to Powergate, you should be fine. If that isn't the case please report the issue in a support channel. We decided to not hide errors from this external package just in case we discover new problems. I've made a deal in Mainnet/Testnet/SR2, how can I know everything is working okay? \u00b6 We recommend using the pow -t <token> data log <pushed-cid> which provides a human-friendy output. Creating deals on any Filecoin network can take over 10hrs and many things can go wrong since Powergate is relatively open to miners that provide storage in the network. They might go offline at any time, be unreliable, or have network problems.

Thats why we built a localnet to enhance app development, testing, and continuous integration scenarios. The required effort is normal on live blockchain networks but isn't ideal in some scenarios. Localnet Features \u00b6 Quick start up Starting the localnet should take under a minute after the docker instances have been installed. Storing a file in a new deal should take about a minute with the default settings and faster with custom settings. The localnet runs a local localnet with a mock sector-builder. This enables fast deployment of a development Filecoin network containing miners with mocked sealing but the rest of the network logic remains the same as the production Filecoin network. The miners are configured to accept and store all incoming deals. Configurable You can change settings such as block generation speed and sector sizes. For CI environments, you may set block production speeds to the order of ~100ms and disable --bigsectors . This localnet setup would be optimized for minimum CPU usage and very fast chain progress, which can confirm deals in seconds. If you require more realistic scenarios (e.g. during product demos), you can change to block production speed to ~1s and enable --bigsectors . This would progress deals slow enough that you can observe updates in the status of confirmed deals at the rate of ~1 minute and also store larger files if required. Warning Not using --bigsectors will limit you to storing files of around 700 bytes and deals will complete in 30-60 seconds. Using --bigsectors will allow you to store files anywhere from 1Mb to 400Mb, but deals will complete in 3-4 minutes. Be sure to choose the value that makes sense for your development scenario. Production compatible storage The localnet is designed to function the same way as the production Filecoin network, except faster and entirely local. The localnet supports both 2KiB and 512MiB sectors and the speed of block production is configurable. For advanced features, refer to the localnet Readme . Localnet Miners \u00b6 Localnet generates miners deterministically when it's started. If you run the localnet with a single miner, the miner's address will be t01000 . If you start the localnet with two miners, the addresses will be t01000 and t01001 . And so on. When running the localnet in Powergate, you can also fetch miner details from the miner API or CLI. Getting Started \u00b6 There are a few resources you'll need before you start running any nodes: Docker Desktop . In the examples below, you'll run node instances using local Docker containers. You can do the same with any Docker-enabled system but to get started, we recommend Docker Desktop and the default configurations provided. Powergate . If you run the localnet as part of the Powergate, you should get the latest version of the Powergate source code. Golang . Building the Powergate CLI from code requires that you can run commands with Go. Other sections of the tutorials below don't require Go. Localnet with Powergate \u00b6 The fastest way to experiment with the Powergate CLI or API is to replace the Lotus client dependency with a running localnet. This will run the Powergate on a Lotus client connected to an embedded network of miners. Installation \u00b6 You can run localnet with a Powergate release or Powergate source code. Download a release \u00b6 Visit the latest Powergate release page and download the powergate-docker-<version>.zip release artifact. Unzip it and cd into the resulting directory: unzip powergate-docker-<version>.zip cd powergate-docker-<version> Use Powergate source code \u00b6 Clone the Powergate and cd into the project's docker directory: git clone git@github.com:textileio/powergate.git cd powergate/docker Setup \u00b6 You can now use the provided docker-compose configuration with whichever option you chose. The default setup runs Powergate connected to a localnet with 512Mib sectors. The gRPC API and CLI are available and don't need any extra config flags. \ud83c\udf8a Run the docker-compose Docker files for the Powergate are contained in the folder, /docker . make localnet Info You can set BIGSECTORS according to your needs. See the description above for more information. If you don't specify a BIGSECTORS environment variable, the default is true . On initial setup, Docker will download the required instances before any Powergate setup begins. Downloads may take a few minutes and only happen on the first run. Once running, you'll begin to see log outputs, including those of the embedded miner. lotus_1 | 2020 -05-29T20:35:08.644Z WARN miner miner/miner.go:177 \\ mined block in the past { \"block-time\" : \"2009-01-01T04:44:30.000Z\" , \\ \"time\" : \"2020-05-29T20:35:08.644Z\" , \"duration\" : 359999438 .64444387 } When complete, you'll have a fully functional Powergate ( powd ), a Lotus localnet, and an IPFS node wired together to start using. Create a deal and store a file \u00b6 The CLI and API are the same in localnet and production except that your deals will store faster and disappear when you delete the localnet. Install the CLI \u00b6 You can install the CLI from a Powergate release or the source code. Download a release \u00b6 Visit the latest Powergate release page and download the pow_<version>_<platform>.tar.gz file appropriate for your system. Unzip and install pow (the following example is for Unix-like systems): tar -xzvf pow_v0.1.0_darwin-amd64.tar.gz ./install Moved ./pow to /usr/local/bin Info If you're installing on macOS, there are some system permissions issue you'll have to deal with. Please follow the hub installation instructions to work around the issue. Build from source code \u00b6 From the root of the powergate repo, you can build the CLI from the latest code. This will install the Powergate CLI, pow , on your machine. make build-pow Test your installation. pow --help Start storing data \u00b6 You're now ready to start storing and retrieving data using the Powergate. Read more on Storing Data . Localnet with Lotus Client \u00b6 You can run the localnet to make use of the Lotus Client with all the benefits described in the introduction but with no Powergate or IPFS components. Run from Docker image \u00b6 You can run localnet with the Docker image we maintain. Running the image is just a single line. docker run --name texlocalnet -e TEXLOTUSDEVNET_SPEED = 1500 \\ -e TEXLOTUSDEVNET_BIGSECTORS = true -p 1234 :7777 \\ -v /tmp/import:/tmp/import textile/lotus-devnet After running the container, the Lotus API endpoint is available at the default port which lets you use the Lotus CLI without any extra configuration. Remember, localnets should be used as ephemeral networks, so be sure to stop and remove the texlocalnet container if you re-rerun the above command again. If you plan to use the ClientImport API or lotus client import command, your target file to import should be in the /tmp/import path on your host machine. This folder is bound to the docker image and the localnet, so the Lotus node can find it under the same path. Finally, notice that the above command doesn't specify the textile/lotus-devnet tag, so it's recommended that you consider updating your cached latest tag. Configuration parameters Above, we used the environmental variables to set the speed and bigsectors flags. The complete mapping of options are: TEXLOTUSDEVNET_SPEED : Time in milliseconds of blocks/tipset generation. TEXLOTUSDEVNET_BIGSECTORS : If true, the localnet will run on 512Mib sectors, but 2Kib otherwise. TEXLOTUSDEVNET_NUMMINERS : The number of miners in the localnet. This is an experimental feature, stable for <=3 miners. TEXLOTUSDEVNET_IPFSADDR : Optional multiaddr of an IPFS node to enable the Lotus node to be connected to an IPFS node to avoid importing deals data, and storing retrievals. Run from source code \u00b6 Requirements Devnet . If you run the localnet with a stand-alone Lotus node, you should get the latest version of the localnet source code. Installation \u00b6 Clone the lotus-devnet repo and cd into the project git clone git@github.com:textileio/lotus-devnet.git cd lotus-devnet Setup \u00b6 Install the dependencies: make build Run the devnet with: go run main.go If you compiled a prior version of lotus-devnet , running make clean is recommended before building again.

On IPFS, the ability to: Store and retrieve data. Track long-term deals on Filecoin. Persist data on Filecoin. Is managed through and scoped to a user . Users can: Manage the necessary state and capabilities. Provide multi-tiered file storage. Intro to Users \u00b6 Users are associated with one or more Filecoin wallet addresses. You can use the Powergate admin API to create a new user. The Powergate will then: Create a new default wallet address for the user. You can configure the Powergate to automatically fund new wallets from a master address. Create a new API token linked to the user. Enable use of the user through the supplied token. Almost all Powergate APIs rely on the user, including the CLI, so you'll need to supply the token to indicate which user your requests are targeting. Since each user has its own address, it has its own balance and therefore limits on the Filecoin network. Warning If you're providing a --lotusmasteraddr and --walletinitialfund , be sure that address exists in the Lotus node and has enough funds, since walletinitialfund attoFILs will be sent from there to fund from newly created users. Both flags are optional, and if not present, there won't be any auto-funding transaction, so you're responsible to fund wallet addresses of new users. Multi-tiered design \u00b6 Powergate provides you API access to a multi-tiered storage system built on IPFS and Filecoin. In many places, we refer to these two tiers of storage as Hot (IFPS) and Cold (Filecoin). This mirrors multi-tiered storage often deployed with a hot storage layer in memory and a cold storage layer on disk . Hot storage layer \u00b6 Data stored in the Powergate hot layer is available to the IPFS network (or private network). Hot storage is designed to be fast and available on the IPFS network (private or public DHT). Data stored with hot enabled is pinned to the Powergate's IPFS node. If Hot Storage is disabled, the IPFS node is still used as transient storage for data in Filecoin. This data will still exist in the IPFS node until a garbage collection runs, so you might benefit from temporal hot storage for retrievals even if you don't have Hot Storage enabled. Cold storage layer \u00b6 Data stored in the Powergate Cold layer is stored by miners on the Filecoin network (localnet or mainnet). You can use the StorageConfig to configure many properties of the Cold storage layer per file you store, such as where, how many copies, and how long to store the file. Moving between tiers \u00b6 Hot to Cold \u00b6 The most common scenario is where data is stored initially with cold disabled and later a new StorageConfig is pushed that enables cold storage. In this scenario, Powergate will resolve the file from the hot layer, and create any newly required Filecoin deals to fulfill. Cold to Hot \u00b6 Data stored only in the cold layer isn't guaranteed to be available on the IPFS network. For it to be available, you need to push a new storage config that enables hot storage. You can automate this movement using the AllowUnfreeze flag of the StorageConfig . Either way, Powergate will always attempt to resolve the data first by trying to fetch it from the IPFS network. If unable to do that, Powergate will execute a retrieval deal to pull the data from Filecoin. Finally, the data will be pinned in hot layer IPFS storage and available on the IPFS network. Read more about updating the StorageConfig here . Using Powergate to store data \u00b6 To start using most Powergate APIs, you must first create a user . Create a user \u00b6 Using the Powergate CLI admin commands, you can create a new user easily. pow admin user create Success { \"user\" : { \"id\" : \"0ac0fb4d-581c-4276-bd90-a9aa30dd4cb4\" , \"token\" : \"883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370\" } } Add environmental variable (optional) The --token is used to scope the requests to the user we created. You can skip setting the --token flag on every command by adding your new token as an environmental variable. For the rest of the examples, we'll assume you've set this environmental variable. export POW_TOKEN = 883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370 Make data available \u00b6 Powergate requires stored data to be available over IPFS. If you're using the CLI, you can ensure it's available by staging it on IPFS using stage . Note that stage does not store your data in the Powergate. It's an optional step that caches your data to ensure it's available on IPFS before being stored in Powergate. This is technically equivalent to ipfs add --pin=false , which is adding data without pinning it. pow data stage <path/filename> Success { \"cid\" : \"<cid>\" } Info If data exists on the IPFS network, you don't need to run stage as the Powergate will automatically fetch that data from remote peers. Initiate storage \u00b6 The Powergate manages stored files based on the setup defined in a StorageConfig . For Powergate to manage a new file by moving it from the cached state created above, to the Hot and/or Cold layers, we must apply a new StorageConfig for the CID we generated above.

The Powergate requires full control over the pinset since it's required when users specify HotStorage.Enabled=true . Manually interacting with the IPFS node's pinset could lead to unexpected behavior in the Powergate. Miner selection \u00b6 Powergate has many internal components that are used to simplify the process of using Filecoin. One set of components are the Powergate's indexes, where it collects information about miners including, power, sector size, storage ask price, etc. With that information, the Powergate can create a reasonable ranking of miners. Miners that are most promising for making deals will show up at the top. When storing data in cold storage, Powergate will use this information to automate finding miners and initiating deals. You can use the StorageConfig to help direct the Powergate to miners that match your particular requirements. Learn more \u00b6 Powergate does a lot of work out of the box.

ThreadDB aims to help power a new generation of web technologies by combining a novel use of event sourcing, Interplanetary Linked Data ( IPLD ), and access control to provide a distributed, scalable, and flexible database solution for decentralized applications. Thread Implementations \u00b6 There are two implementations of ThreadDB. Golang \u00b6 The first is written in Go and the implementation reference can be found at https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/ . In this reference, you'll find: All the latest components to use as a library. How to write trustless services. How to build a client connected to a threads daemon. More documentation for the Go implementation will be coming in the future. JavaScript \u00b6 The second implementation is written in JavaScript (Typescript, really). This implementation has some optimizations to make it more ideal when writing web applications. The JavaScript implementation is currently a Client of the Go implementation. You can run it against your own go-threads instance or connect it to the Textile Hub to use one of ours. Read more about the Client here . In general, when building apps that use threads in a remote context, like the browser, it's best to push the networking later to remote services whenever possible (while using/allowing p2p when it works). You can also build your own remote relays and services using the go-threads library. For the rest of the explanation below, we'll focus on examples using the JavaScript library. Developer API \u00b6 ThreadDB is designed to be simple enough for any developer to start using. The API will feel familiar to developers who have worked with technologies like MongoDB. Important concepts \u00b6 The first three concepts developers will encounter with ThreadDB are Threads , Collections , and Instances . Instances are the individual records you create , update , or delete . Instances are stored in a Collection . Collections have one or many Schemas and can only store Instances that match one of those Schemas . Databases can store many Collections . Collections are similar to Tables in other databases. A Thread -based Database is tied to a single Thread (with associated Thread ID). Creating a new thread \u00b6 To start a new, empty Thread, with remote networking using the Hub APIs, initialize your Thread with the UserAuth object. You can read more about creating UserAuth objects in the creating web apps tutorial . Create a new Thread API client import { Client , PrivateKey , UserAuth } from '@textile/hub' async function setup ( auth : UserAuth ) { const user = await PrivateKey . fromRandom () const client = await Client . withUserAuth ( auth ) return client } Authorize a new user to use your Hub API You must generate a new API token for each user you want on your API. import { Client , PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' async function newToken ( client : Client , user : PrivateKey ) { const token = await client . getToken ( user ) return token } List a user's existing Threads import { Client } from '@textile/hub' async function list ( client : Client ) { const threads = await client . listThreads () return threads } Create a new database import { Client , Identity , ThreadID , UserAuth } from '@textile/hub' async function createDB ( client : Client ) { const thread : ThreadID = await client . newDB () return thread } Congrats! You now have a new ThreadDB! Each ThreadDB has a unique ThreadID . You can create your own ThreadIDs, or easily generate a random ThreadID as we do in the above example. Invite \u00b6 You can invite multiple users to the same thread. Use this to build chat apps, collaborative documents, and more. import { Client , DBInfo , ThreadID } from '@textile/hub' async function getInfo ( client : Client , threadID : ThreadID ) : Promise < DBInfo > { return await client . getDBInfo ( threadID ) } async function joinFromInfo ( client : Client , info : DBInfo ) { return await client . joinFromInfo ( info ) } Once you get the DB info, you need to send that to the other users you want to join. To do that, we recommend the User Mailbox API . Collections \u00b6 Collections are used to handle different data structures in the same Database. Each Collection is defined by a json-schema.org schema . These schemas define the shape of Collection Instances (the individual entries). Collections are similar to tables in other databases. Ultimately, a Collection is a single document store with a set of APIs to make it feel like a local database table . Collections can be created from an existing Schema or Object. Create from schema import { Client , ThreadID } from '@textile/hub' // Define a simple person schema const schema = { $schema : 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#' , title : 'Person' , type : 'object' , properties : { _id : { type : 'string' }, name : { type : 'string' }, missions : { type : 'number' , minimum : 0 , exclusiveMaximum : 100 , }, }, } // Requires the started database we created above async function collectionFromSchema ( client : Client , threadID : ThreadID ) { await client . newCollection ( threadID , { name : 'Astronauts' , schema : schema }) } Instances \u00b6 Instances are the objects you store in your Collection. Instances are JSON documents with schemas that match those defined in your Collection. Get all Instances import { Client , ThreadID } from '@textile/hub' async function findEntity ( client : Client , threadId : ThreadID , collection : string ) { const found = await client . find ( threadId , collection , {}) console . debug ( 'found:' , found . length ) } Add an Instance import { Client , ThreadID } from '@textile/hub' // matches YourModel and schema async function create ( client : Client , threadId : ThreadID , collection : string ) { const created = await client . create ( threadId , collection , [{ some : 'data' , numbers : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] }]) } Query \u00b6 Each Threads implementation supports query and look-up capabilities such as insert , findOne , has , and more. ThreadDB also supports the MongoDB query language . In the JavaScript library, you might write queries like the following. import { Client , ThreadID , QueryJSON } from '@textile/hub' // Requires the started database we generated above containing the Player collection async function createQuery ( client : Client , threadID : ThreadID , query : QueryJSON ) { // Get results const all = await client . find ( threadID , 'astronauts' , query ) return all } Listen \u00b6 You can also subscribe to changes in a database. import { Client , PrivateKey , ThreadID , Update } from '@textile/hub' const userID = PrivateKey . fromRandom () interface Astronaut { _id : string name : string missions : number } const callback = async ( reply? : Update < Astronaut > , err? : Error ) => { console . log ( reply . instance ) } // Requires userID already be authenticated to the Users API async function startListener ( client : Client , threadID : ThreadID ) { const filters = [{ actionTypes : [ 'CREATE' ]}] const closer = client . listen < Astronaut > ( threadID , filters , callback ) return closer } Access-control \u00b6 ThreadDB uses a modular role-based access control system that allows access control lists (ACLs) to be declared in a wide variety of ways. ACLs are in active development and you can follow the development here . Identity \u00b6 ThreadDB allows you to handle user identities (for access control and security/encryption) in the best way for your app and users. To handle multiple peers collaborating on a single database, as well as the ability to handle storage on behalf of a user, ThreadDB expects a simple Identity interface for signing and validating database updates. See the Hub documentation on user identities for details. Connect to the Hub \u00b6 Create an Account Create an App Token Add the Textile Hub Library to your App Pinning, Relay, and Replication \u00b6 Thread Services (e.g. pinning encrypted data on IPFS and helping multiple peers relay updates across the network) can be built and deployed to the network using go-threads . Textile offers a number of these functions through the Hub. Attaching the Hub to your databases will allow you to deliver a high-quality user experience. Installation \u00b6 ThreadDB can be used with many languages and has libraries written in JavaScript and Go. Find documentation on each of those libraries below. JavaScript Add Threads to NodeJS, React Native or browser apps. Golang Use Threads in Go or compile to many other platforms. Advanced Details \u00b6 The protocols and design of ThreadDB can be explored in detail in the whitepaper: A protocol & event-sourced database for decentralized user-siloed data .

The contents of .env will look like: USER_API_KEY = textile-hub-user-group-key You can follow the instructions to generate a User Group Key here . If you already generated keys, you can list them by executing hub keys ls . Add the values to your .env file on the right side of the equality sign. Typescript The rest of the JavaScript portions in this tutorial will be in TypeScript. You don't need to use TypeScript but if you don't, be sure to strip the typings from any code you copy below. Build your app \u00b6 Hint In the example app, we put all the ThreadDB and Bucket logic into a single component called checklist.ts . You can view that file for reference. Import Textile // Buckets client and an API Context helper import { Buckets , Client , ThreadID , PrivateKey , Where } from '@textile/hub' ; Register with remote API \u00b6 Next, we'll connect to the remote API using our key from an insecure (non-signing) API key. Read more about keys for development mode . We do this so the user can later push their bucket for remote persistence on IPFS and publishing on IPNS. import { Client } from '@textile/hub' const client = Client . withKeyInfo ({ key : 'USER_API_KEY' , }) Hint Read more about the Context tool in the Threads Introduction . Generate an Identity \u00b6 Read the basic identities tutorial here . import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' async function example () { const id = await PrivateKey . fromRandom (); return id } Here, we're just using a helper to generate a private-key identity for the user. Generate User Token \u00b6 import { Client , PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' async function example ( client : Client , identity : PrivateKey ) { await client . getToken ( identity ); } This will register the user with your remote Hub account, granting them the ability to push data to IPFS through Threads and Buckets. Connect Buckets \u00b6 Now that your user is setup and connected to your API on the Hub, you can start creating Buckets. First, setup a Bucket instance. import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' const buckets = Buckets . withKeyInfo ({ key : 'USER_API_KEY' , }) In the code above, we reuse the Context we already created in our ThreadDB Client because it contains the token, API keys, etc. Info If you already created a connection using the Threads client , you can directly transfer that connection to Buckets with Buckets.copyAuth(client) . List all Buckets import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' async function find ( buckets : Buckets ) { const roots = await buckets . list (); const exists = roots . find (( bucket ) => bucket . name === 'buckets' ) return exists } Open a Bucket The easiest way to start pushing/pulling bucket files is to use the open method with just the bucket name you intend to use. import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' async function find ( buckets : Buckets , name : string ) { const root = await buckets . open ( name ) return root // root.key is the bucket key } Push files to User Bucket \u00b6 Finally, let's push a simple file to the user's Bucket. In this example, we'll just create a simple HTML file that says, Hello world . import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' async function example ( buckets : Buckets , bucketKey : string , content : string ) { const file = { path : '/index.html' , content : Buffer.from ( content ) } const raw = await buckets . pushPath ( bucketKey , 'index.html' , file ) } Updating User Bucket \u00b6 When you update your Bucket: The Thread containing the Bucket will be updated . The Bucket's HTTP URL and IPNS address updates to reflects those updates. The Bucket will get a new IPFS address (CID) any time you change it. This gives you a lot of options for building apps, delivering content, and doing cool things for your users with their data. To get each of the protocol addresses, read below. List the Bucket links \u00b6 Finally, you can list the links to the file on IPFS, IPNS, ThreadDB, and HTTP. HTTP Address \u00b6 Textile gives you and your users a public address for each Bucket created. They are created using the Bucket key and you can generate those as follows: https://${bucket-key}.textile.space IPFS Address \u00b6 The IPFS address is contained in the result of pushPath . import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' async function example ( buckets : Buckets , bucketKey : string , file : Buffer ) { const raw = await buckets . pushPath ( bucketKey ! , 'index.html' , file ) console . log ( raw . root ) } IPNS Address \u00b6 The IPNS Address is always the same and is the Bucket key! If you want to see the Bucket over IPNS from a gateway, you can use the Textile gateway as follows: https://${bucket-key}.ipns.hub.textile.io/ ThreadDB Address \u00b6 You can generate a link to the Bucket with the user thread as follows: https://${thread-id}.thread.hub.textile.io/buckets/${this.state.bucket-key} Warning Remember, at this point, Buckets are entirely open, data is available to be viewed or downloaded by anyone your app or user shares the link with. Code \u00b6 Check out a complete React Native project on GitHub that generates a User Identity, Thread, and Bucket. Android setup \u00b6 Simply npm install and then npm run android from the root of the react-native-hub-app folder. iOS setup \u00b6 If npm run ios doesn't work for you immediately after npm install , follow these steps. Be sure you ran npm install . Be sure you have updated your .env file. Start the react native server, npm run start . Open Xcode Open the iOS project, ./ios/threadsdb_app.xcworkspace .

The Textile Hub supports public-key infrastructure (PKI), which allows your app to integrate different PKI-based user identity providers (e.g. Metamask, 3Box, uPort, Blockstack) or roll your own. Most of our examples use a simple, platform-agnostic keypair identity based on ed2559 and by extending the Noble ed2559 library . Key-based identity access \u00b6 The Hub can help verify that users are who they claim to be by using encryption. The general flow is as follows: A user attempts to sign-in by providing their public key . Your app creates a one-time challenge for the users. The user signs the challenge with their private key to generate credentials . Your app verifies the credentials . Below, we'll simplify these steps by using the Hub's helpful token generation endpoint that also does credential verification. Generating an identity \u00b6 In this example, we'll use an identity based on an ed2559 signature scheme and made available through the @textile/hub library. Install dependency npm install --save @textile/hub Generating Identities You can use the PrivateKey utility to generate random new identities (private and public keys) and later, to sign challenges to prove private key ownership. import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' ; async function example () { /** Random new identity */ const identity = await PrivateKey . fromRandom () /** Convert to string. */ const identityString = identity . toString () /** Restore an identity object from a string */ const restored = PrivateKey . fromString ( identityString ) } All of the instances above are different representations of the same user-generated by PrivateKey.fromRandom() . Each instance holds a different copy of the user's private key and therefore should remain private between your app and your user. Caching user identity \u00b6 You can add simple client-side caching to store a user's identity in the browser and restore it when the user returns to the app. Warning localStorage isn't a secure place to store secrets. localStorage access is also not guaranteed and may be cleared by the browser, the system, or the users. You should provide alternative storage mechanisms if maintaining identity (and therefore data ownership and access) over time is important. import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' ; const getIdentity = async () : Promise < PrivateKey > => { /** Restore any cached user identity first */ const cached = localStorage . getItem ( \"user-private-identity\" ) if ( cached !== null ) { /** Convert the cached identity string to a PrivateKey and return */ return PrivateKey . fromString ( cached ) } /** No cached identity existed, so create a new one */ const identity = await PrivateKey . fromRandom () /** Add the string copy to the cache */ localStorage . setItem ( \"identity\" , identity . toString ()) /** Return the random identity */ return identity } Signing transactions \u00b6 The PrivateKey object contains a signing method that allows your app to sign arbitrary bytes for your users. You can create your own identity verification endpoint or use the Hub's token endpoint to verify the credentials. import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' ; async function sign ( identity : PrivateKey ) { const challenge = Buffer . from ( 'Sign this string' ); const credentials = identity . sign ( challenge ); return credentials } Advanced identity providers \u00b6 Public key provider \u00b6 The code below shows two generic identity interfaces. You can import these interfaces from @textile/hub . // Read more https://textileio.github.io/js-textile/docs/hub.public interface Public { verify ( data : Buffer , sig : Buffer ) : Promise < boolean > } // Read more https://textileio.github.io/js-textile/docs/hub.identity interface Identity { sign ( data : Buffer ) : Promise < Buffer > public : Public } Identity here represents any entity capable of signing a message. It requires that the implementer is capable of returning an associated public key for verification. This interface design was inspired by public key infrastructure . In many cases, the Identity will just be a private key, but callers can use any setup that suits their needs. The default implementation is based on the Noble ed2559 library but many developers will want to use alternative identity provides, such as 3box/Ceramic , Fortmatic , and existing private/public key-pair, or a web3 provider such as Metamask . Textile Hub also provides email-based identities. Metamask \u00b6 One issue with the above workflow is that you need to help users store and recover their private keys. You could do this with your user model stored over an API. Alternatively, you can use any key-pair manager, such as Metamask . There are a few steps to generate a Textile compatible identity from the Metamask API. We've provided an example using Metamask here . In the above example, we allow you to generate a new ed25519 key for your users based on their Ethereum address in Metamask. This key is deterministic, meaning that as long as your user maintains access to their address in Metamask and their account secret, they can recover the same ed25519 key. This is handy if you don't want to store your user's private keys outside the app or use unreliable storage (e.g. local storage in browsers). It does this as follows: It prompts the user for a new secret . The secret helps ensure that another app cannot easily trick the user into generating their ed25519 key. The app then creates a unique string that contains a hashed version of the secret, the app name, and some additional text . The app can regenerate this string at any time in the future if the user supplies their secret . The unique string is then signed with the user's Ethereum address by using the Metamask API . The resulting signature is used to generate an ed25519 key that can be used as an identity with all Textile APIs. There are some benefits to this approach over using the ethereum address directly. An obvious one is that there is no public association between an ethereum address and the ed25519 key. 3Box \u00b6 Another good starting point is with 3Box SDK . 3Box manages a cluster of nodes where web3 users can push small bits of information. 3Box provides some helpful abstractions that integrate with Metamask and can help you create, manage, and recover keys for your users. In this approach, a user with a 3Box identity can use that identity to create and track Buckets or Threads generated on Textile. We've provided an example using 3Box here . Info As of the time of writing, November 16, 2020, 3Box does not have Typescript typings available. import { PrivateKey } from '@textile/hub' const Box = require ( \"3box\" ); const getIdentity = async () : Promise < PrivateKey > => { const box = await Box . create (( window as any ). ethereum ) const [ address ] = await ( window as any ). ethereum . enable () await box . auth ([], { address }) const space = await box . openSpace ( 'io-textile-3box-docs' ) await box . syncDone let identity : PrivateKey try { var storedIdent = await space . private . get ( \"ed25519-identity\" ) if ( storedIdent === null ) { throw new Error ( 'No identity' ) } identity = await PrivateKey . fromString ( storedIdent ) return identity } catch ( e ) { try { identity = await PrivateKey . fromRandom () const identityString = identity . toString () await space . private . set ( \"ed25519-identity\" , identityString ) } catch ( err ) { return err . message } } } Next steps \u00b6 Time to setup your app in development mode .","title":"User identities"},{"location":"tutorials/hub/pki-identities/#user-identities","text":"This section will focus on how to create user identities with private-keys.

To work with API keys in a production environment: Generate a new API key and secret that has mandatory signing enabled. Setup an authorization endpoint that will hold your API secret and any optional user model for your app. Add a login step to your app that will use the new endpoint to authorize users in your app. Differences from development mode \u00b6 Users need a signature to accompany their API requests. Those signatures can only be created with your API secret and will expire. You'll need to re-verify the signatures occasionally. For this, we'll move from using the withKeyInfo APIs to a new one called withUserAuth that can request updated signatures in your app. withUserAuth is also designed to work without access to your secret , so your app can authorize users on your back-end and provide API key signatures on demand. Other than that, all the APIs work the same way. User identity \u00b6 If you've followed the tutorials up until now, you're already using PKI , so your users will only ever share their public key with your API (or any API). Therefore, you just need to verify that they hold the private key linked with the public key. Otherwise, users could spoof your system very easily. From there, you can provide Hub API access to your users based on that verification. Authentication server \u00b6 Now, we'll setup a simple server that accepts a user's public key, verifies that they control the private key (via a challenge), and then grant the user access to the Hub APIs. The user can pass the result (a UserAuth object) to the API and start creating Threads and Buckets. Setup \u00b6 There are a few resources you'll need before you start writing code. An account . This is your developer account on the Hub. A user group key . This is how your users access the Hub APIs. Consider creating the key in an organization and not your personal account so you can invite collaborators later. A new Typescript project . We recommend using Typescript, as Textile libraries are in a stage rapid of development and type detection is valuable during upgrades. A server framework. The example below uses KoaJS but it could just as easily be written with Express or the basic Node server. Install dependencies # Textile libraries npm install --save @textile/hub # Other utilities used in example npm install --save dotenv emittery isomorphic-ws # Libraries specific to our server framework, koajs npm install --save koa koa-router koa-logger koa-json koa-bodyparser koa-route koa-websocket Environment variables We use a .env file in the root of our project repo. The values in this file will be pulled into the app each time it's run. This is where you'll add your Hub API key and secret. Danger The .env file should be added to your .gitignore so your key and secret are never shared. Contents of .env . USER_API_KEY=<insert user group key> USER_API_SECRET=<insert user group secret> Create the server \u00b6 In our project setup, our main server is defined in src/index.ts . Unlike the simple credentials example , our server needs to handle two-way communication with the client during identity verification. The flow is as follows: The client makes a login request . The server initiates the request with the Hub and gets back an identity challenge . The server passes the challenge to the client . The client confirms they own their private key by signing the challenge and passing it back to the server . The server passes it to the Hub. If successful , a token is generated for the user and the server generates API credentials and passes the credentials, token, and API key back to the client . Now, the client can use the Hub APIs directly! It sounds complicated, but you'll see it happens very fast with only a few lines of code. In our example, we use websockets to enable the multi-step communication between the server and the client. /** Provides nodejs access to a global Websocket value, required by Hub API */ ;( global as any ). WebSocket = require ( 'isomorphic-ws' ) import koa from \"koa\" import Router from \"koa-router\" import logger from \"koa-logger\" import json from \"koa-json\" import bodyParser from \"koa-bodyparser\" import route from \"koa-route\" import websockify from \"koa-websocket\" import Emittery from \"emittery\" import dotenv from \"dotenv\" import { Client , UserAuth } from \"@textile/hub\" /** Read the values of .env into the environment */ dotenv . config (); /** Port our server will run */ const PORT : number = 3000 /** Init Koa with Websocket support */ const app = websockify ( new koa ()) /** Middlewares */ app . use ( json () ) app . use ( logger () ) app . use ( bodyParser () ) /** * Add websocket login endpoint */ /** Start the server! */ app . listen ( PORT , () => console . log ( \"Server started.\" ) ) Add a websocket login handler \u00b6 Next, we'll add a websocket endpoint to our server. Note the Add websocket login endpoint location in the server code above. The primary step the server needs to do is accept a pubkey and issue a new challenge back to the client. When successful, new API credentials can be handed to the client. View the full code example in the repo . import { Client } from '@textile/hub' async function example ( pubkey : string ) { /** * Init new Hub API Client with the user group API keys */ const client = await Client . withKeyInfo ({ key : 'USER_API_KEY' , secret : 'USER_API_SECRET' , }) /** * Request a token from the Hub based on the user public key */ const token = await client . getTokenChallenge ( pubkey , /** The callback passes the challenge back to the client */ ( challenge : Buffer ) => { return new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { // Send the challenge back to the client and // resolve(Buffer.from(sig)) resolve () }) }) } Now when you refresh your locally running server, you should have a websocket endpoint for client token creation. Wrap-up \u00b6 With the user verified in your system, you can keep their public key without any security issues. However, you should never trust an API call only by the public key, the challenge step is critical . The token provided in the response should be considered a secret that only should be shared with a single user. It does not expire. Example on GitHub \u00b6 If you'd like to learn more, we've provided a fully working example on GitHub: Login API Source code for login and Hub credentials endpoint. Client (app) authentication \u00b6 Now that our credentials endpoint is setup, we need to generate new credentials for each user's identity. A basic client needs to be able to: Submit a login request . Handle a challenge request from the server. Sign the challenge . Return it over websockets . We'll create a login function that handles the back and forth of the websocket and can combine with the withUserAuth function. Login function \u00b6 import { Buckets , Client , Identity , PrivateKey , UserAuth } from '@textile/hub' /** * loginWithChallenge uses websocket to initiate and respond to * a challenge for the user based on their keypair. * * Read more about setting up user verification here: * https://docs.textile.io/tutorials/hub/web-app/ */ const loginWithChallenge = ( id : Identity ) => { return () : Promise < UserAuth > => { return new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { /** * Configured for our development server * * Note: this should be upgraded to wss for production environments. */ const socketUrl = `ws://localhost:3001/ws/userauth` /** Initialize our websocket connection */ const socket = new WebSocket ( socketUrl ) /** Wait for our socket to open successfully */ socket . onopen = () => { /** Get public key string */ const publicKey = id . public . toString (); /** Send a new token request */ socket . send ( JSON . stringify ({ pubkey : publicKey , type : 'token' , })) /** Listen for messages from the server */ socket . onmessage = async ( event ) => { const data = JSON . parse ( event . data ) switch ( data . type ) { /** Error never happen :) */ case 'error' : { reject ( data . value ) break } /** The server issued a new challenge */ case 'challenge' : { /** Convert the challenge json to a Buffer */ const buf = Buffer . from ( data . value ) /** User our identity to sign the challenge */ const signed = await id . sign ( buf ) /** Send the signed challenge back to the server */ socket . send ( JSON . stringify ({ type : 'challenge' , sig : Buffer.from ( signed ). toJSON (), })) break } /** New token generated */ case 'token' : { resolve ( data . value ) break } } } } }) } } const setupThreads = async ( identity : Identity ) => { /** * By passing a callback, the Threads library can refresh * the api signature whenever expiring. */ const callback = loginWithChallenge ( identity ) const client = Client . withUserAuth ( callback ) client . getToken ( identity ) return client } Convert Buckets from insecure API to secure API \u00b6 If you're looking to convert your Buckets from using the insecure API to the secure one, see the code below: Insecure keys example When using your insecure API key, you typically initialized Buckets like the following: import { Buckets , Identity , KeyInfo } from '@textile/hub' const init = async ( key : KeyInfo , identity : Identity ) => { const buckets = await Buckets . withKeyInfo ( key ) await buckets . getToken ( identity ) return buckets } Secure keys example You'll now replace withKeyInfo and getToken with the single, withUserAuth method that requires the callback method: import { Buckets , UserAuth } from '@textile/hub' const init = ( getUserAuth : (() => Promise < UserAuth > )) => { const buckets = Buckets . withUserAuth ( getUserAuth ) return buckets } Wrap-up \u00b6 Now you've had a chance to see how identities work with API keys to provide Hub resources to your users.

We'll build an example that allows users of your app to post photo galleries to IPFS, IPNS, and HTTP using Buckets. Getting Started \u00b6 There are a few resources you'll need before you start writing code. A new Typescript web app . We recommend using Typescript, as Textile libraries are in a period rapid of development and type detection is valuable during upgrades. You should already be familiar with how to create user identities and how to generate API keys. Initialize Buckets \u00b6 In your app, there are two items you'll regularly use when building with Buckets. The Buckets class object where you'll initialize an API client for your user and call bucket methods. The key of any bucket you want to interact with regularly since you'll need to tell the API which Bucket you're acting on. So, to get started in our app, we're going to do three things at once. Create a new Bucket object . Create or fetch the existing bucket of interest by name. Get the key of the bucket. Info For this tutorial, you'll be using an API key generated as part of a User Group key. It's possible to use Account Keys together with these APIs but they do not work in the same way since only Account owners (or Org members) can use them. A User Group key will allow you to create buckets for each user of your app. import { Buckets , Identity , KeyInfo } from '@textile/hub' const setup = async ( key : KeyInfo , identity : Identity ) => { // Use the insecure key to set up the buckets client const buckets = await Buckets . withKeyInfo ( key ) // Authorize the user and your insecure keys with getToken await buckets . getToken ( identity ) const result = await buckets . open ( 'io.textile.dropzone' ) if ( ! result . root ) { throw new Error ( 'Failed to open bucket' ) } return { buckets : buckets , bucketKey : result.root.key , } } Create a photo index \u00b6 If you're going to allow users to upload more than a few images or files, it can be helpful to track the metadata in an index. In our final example, we resample the photos on the fly, storing multiple sizes for better display performance. We track all those files with a simple JSON index in the root of our bucket. It would be better to store that index right in the user's Thread! But we wanted to keep this tutorial simple. import { Buckets , Identity } from '@textile/hub' const initIndex = async ( buckets : Buckets , bucketKey : string , identity : Identity ) => { // Create a json model for the index const index = { author : identity.public.toString (), date : ( new Date ()). getTime (), paths : [], } // Store the index in the Bucket (or in the Thread later) const buf = Buffer . from ( JSON . stringify ( index , null , 2 )) const path = `index.json` await buckets . pushPath ( bucketKey , path , buf ) } Now you can update the paths each time you add new images to the bucket. In our example, we add 4 files for every image, full-res, medium-res, thumbnail, and metadata. We also update the paths with a link to the file's metadata on each update. In this way, an app can load just the single list of metadata and decide what to display. Create a public view \u00b6 Buckets are cross-protocol objects meaning that you can use them in IPFS, IPNS, or HTTP. If you want to create a public view of a bucket over HTTP, you should add an index.html to the root. In our example, we add an index.html that knows how to parse and display files based on the ./index.json stored above, in the same bucket. import { Buckets , Identity } from '@textile/hub' const addIndexHTML = async ( buckets : Buckets , bucketKey : string , html : string ) => { // Store the index.html in the root of the bucket const buf = Buffer . from ( html ) const path = `index.html` await buckets . pushPath ( bucketKey , path , buf ) } Push files \u00b6 You're now ready to start pushing files to the bucket. You can push each binary file to a specific path in the bucket by using pushPath . import { Buckets , PushPathResult } from '@textile/hub' const insertFile = ( buckets : Buckets , bucketKey : string , file : File , path : string ) : Promise < PushPathResult > => { return new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { const reader = new FileReader () reader . onabort = () => reject ( 'file reading was aborted' ) reader . onerror = () => reject ( 'file reading has failed' ) reader . onload = () => { const binaryStr = reader . result // Finally, push the full file to the bucket buckets . pushPath ( bucketKey , path , binaryStr ). then (( raw ) => { resolve ( raw ) }) } reader . readAsArrayBuffer ( file ) }) } At this point, we also update our index.json with the new file. Push encrypted buckets \u00b6 If your app is providing private spaces for your users to organize their photos or files, you can also create encrypted buckets for them. The open and init methods on the Bucket class take an isEncrypted option. Your bucket start method may look like: import { Buckets } from '@textile/hub' const openEncrypted = async ( buckets : Buckets ) => { const isEncrypted = true const result = await buckets . open ( 'io.textile.encrypted' , undefined , isEncrypted ) if ( ! result . root ) { throw new Error ( 'Failed to open bucket' ) } return { buckets : buckets , bucketKey : result.root.key , } } Sharing encrypted buckets \u00b6 There is no way to convert encrypted Buckets to non-encrypted or vice-versa. However, it should be straight-forward to move files from an encrypted Bucket into a non-encrypted Bucket and back again. Adding multiple readers or writers to Buckets is only currently available through orgs for developers, not app users. However, we will include this ability in future releases. This is dependent on our work to implement more advanced Threads ACLs . Be aware that creating encrypted Buckets still posts files to IPFS. Meaning the encrypted contents of Buckets are still publicly available, just encrypted so not possible to view without the encryption keys.

User mailboxes are designed to be used with private key based identities where each user will privately encrypt messages for recipients based on the recipient's public key. Info You can read more about creating basic PKI identities in our tutorial . A common challenge app developers face is how to exchange small, private information from one user to another. Take for example, using Threads to handle chat messages between users. Chat is a great use for Threads but faces an initial challenge: Challenge How do you send Thread invite details from one user to another, before the thread exists? Solution User mailboxes!

Your app user checks their Hub inbox using your API key. Your user can pull any available messages (by recency or other simple filters). Any message body will be encrypted, so decrypting the message using their private key is required. The user can then read and verify that the message came from the recipient. Creating mailboxes \u00b6 A user's mailbox needs to be initialized by them (through your app) before other users can begin sending them messages.
