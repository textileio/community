Libraries are under active development, and this material may not reflect the latest changes. Please view the primary code-repositories and look out for our release announcements soon. Welcome to Textile! This is a great place to start if you're a developer interested in using Textile's decentralized tooling in your mobile, desktop, or web applications. Introduction \u00b6 Textile is a set of tools to help you and your team build decentralized apps, fast. Textile is primarily built on IPFS and makes it easy for you or your application to store and distribute data over the IPFS network. Some features of Textile you may find useful include: Push files, directories, and websites to the IPFS network. Textile's Buckets are an intuitive way for you to host and manage data on IPFS. Buckets run on IPFS and Threads, but you don't have to remember content addresses to use them! Collaboratively update and manage Buckets with your team through simple collaborative projects and access control. Your organization can quickly host app assets or entire webpages on IPFS. Integration with CI tools makes this a breeze. Add decentralized databases to your web, mobile, or desktop application. Create databases on IPFS that are private for one user or shared with many. The Threads DB is an advanced decentralized database and networking protocol for IPFS. Other things about Textile and Threads you may like include their open source, MIT licenses, active developer support on our public Slack group , and a deep technical paper to get your neurons firing. Getting Started \u00b6 Textile is a command-line interface that gives you access to everything listed above and more. To get started, here's what you need to do Info Download Textile to your computer. You can find the latest release for on our GitHub releases page . Textile is built for all the common architectures used in Mac (Darwin), Windows, and Linux. If your architecture isn't listed, ping us on Slack and we can give you instructions to build a version ready for your system. Run Textile for the first time, the help command is a useful place to start. textile --help The Textile client. Usage: textile [ command ] Available Commands: buckets Manage project buckets help Help about any command init Init a new project login Login logout Logout projects Manage projects switch Switch teams or personal account teams Team management whoami Show user or team Teams and Projects \u00b6 To start using remote services such as IPFS pinning, Bucket sharing, and Thread APIs, you'll need an account on Textile. Textile provides a simple, password-less account setup. You can create a new account by logging in with your valid email address for the first time. Login \u00b6 textile login Enter your email: you@domain.app\u2588 > We sent an email to you@domain.app. Please follow the steps provided inside it. Go to your inbox and look for the verification email and follow the instructions inside. After complete, your terminal should output a confirmation: \u2714 Email confirmed > Success! You are now logged in. Initialize a new project directory with ` textile init ` . That's it, you can now start using Textile, IPFS, and Threads. Create a Team \u00b6 By default, you'll be on your own in Textile, you'll probably want to create (or join) a team before you start building. textile teams add <new team name> Switch to Team \u00b6 To use your new team, you need to use the switch command to select your newly created team. textile switch Use the arrow keys to navigate: \u2193 \u2191 \u2192 \u2190 ? Switch to: \u25b8 you@domain.app ( current ) <new team name> Invite another member to your team \u00b6 textile teams invite Enter email to invite: other@domain.app\u2588 > Success! We sent other@domain.app an invitation to the new team. Join a team \u00b6 If someone else has already created a team for you to join, you'll receive an invite email. Simply follow the instructions in the email to join and use the new team. List your teams \u00b6 textile teams ls NAME ID <new team name> f62cdc2b-9404-40ed-8467-ea804fcc35f1 > Found 2 teams Create a Project \u00b6 Teams on Textile may create different Projects. Projects are useful to organize resources or user groups in your app. Creating a new one is simple. First, navigate to the directory where you'd like to build your project, mkdir txtl-project cd txtl-project/ Next, tell Textile to create a project in this directory. Similar to Git, Textile will create a simple config file in this directly under, .textile/config.yaml . textile projects init my-new-project > Success! Initialized empty project in /Users/me/txtl-project/.textile Because you are have switched to your team, this project should now be available to other members of your team also. Host data in Buckets \u00b6 Textile includes a textile buckets tool that makes it simple for you to pin files to IFPS. The files you pin can be used as part or all of the interface to your dApp. You can think of buckets much like you might already think of buckets on S3 (or if you aren't familiar, just think of them as folders). As an extra bonus, if any bucket you create contains an index.html file, Textile will host the bucket as a web site at https://<bucket-name>.textile.cafe . Read on to see an example. Push files \u00b6 To start pinning files in your Textile project, use the push sub command. You can push a single file to a bucket or an entire directory, in which case all contained files and directories are pushed recursively. All paths will be created if they don't exist and you can use push repeatedly to keep adding more files to a bucket. Here, we push files for a static web site to a bucket called aaron : textile buckets push public/* aaron Add 44 files? Press ENTER to confirm: \u2588 > Pushing mySite/public/404/index.html to aaron/404/index.html 9 .87 kB / 9 .87 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 78 .69 kB p/s 0s > Pushing mySite/public/404.html to aaron/404.html 9 .88 kB / 9 .88 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 260 .14 kB p/s 1s > Pushing mySite/public/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js to aaron/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js 98 .14 kB / 98 .14 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 307 .59 kB p/s 0s > Pushing mySite/public/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js.map to aaron/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js.map 390 .09 kB / 390 .09 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 376 .47 kB p/s 1s > Pushing mySite/public/chunk-map.json to aaron/chunk-map.json ... > Success! Pushed 44 files to aaron Inspecting a bucket \u00b6 You can list the files in a bucket or at any depth in the bucket, similar to listing files locally on your computer: textile buckets ls aaron/icons NAME SIZE DIR ITEMS PATH icon-144x144.png 9130 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-144x144.png icon-192x192.png 12422 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-192x192.png icon-256x256.png 16837 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-256x256.png icon-384x384.png 29004 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-384x384.png icon-48x48.png 2813 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-48x48.png icon-512x512.png 22446 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-512x512.png icon-72x72.png 4425 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-72x72.png icon-96x96.png 5926 false n/a /ipfs/QmSe8nSJsAW7eJXvMP5gYM6TCkuyJKeU8MusHs2kVBdFMZ/icons/icon-96x96.png > Found 8 items Pulling files \u00b6 Use the buckets pull command to download files from a bucket to your computer. You can pull an entire bucket, a sub tree of a bucket, or a single file. textile buckets pull aaron/icons/icon-512x512.png ./ > Pulling aaron/icons/icon-512x512.png to icon-512x512.png 22 .45 kB / 22 .45 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 818 .35 kB p/s 0s > Success! Pulled 1 files to ./ Removing files \u00b6 The buckets rm command is used to remove files or directories from a bucket. Once a bucket is empty, the root bucket directory is deleted and will no longer appear in the list of buckets output from textile buckets ls . textile buckets rm aaron/aaron.txt > Success! Removed aaron/aaron.txt Accessing on cloud.textile.io \u00b6 You can access the latest version of the files in your bucket (without needing to know any CID!) at https://cloud.textile.io/dashboard/<project name>/<bucket name> . Of course since the data is all stored in IPFS, it's also available over https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID> . The CID for any Textile bucket or bucket sub directory is listed at the top of the corresponding cloud.textile.io/dahsboard page and in the output from textile buckets ls . Hosting web sites in Buckets \u00b6 Any bucket that contains an index.html file will be hosted as a web site at https://<bucket-name>.textile.cafe . In the textile buckets push example above, we pushed files that make up a static web site to a bucket named aaron . That web site is automatically available (with TLS!) at https://aaron.textile.cafe . Read more about hosting websites in Buckets here . Updating Buckets with CI \u00b6 Buckets can be managed as part of your CI workflows. Read more about updating your Buckets in CI here . A Decentralized Database \u00b6 A scalable, secure, multi-user, database for developers Want simple Filebase or MongoDB type functionality in your app? Textile provides Threads - A decentralized database built on IPFS. Threads give your app a way to store private data for one user or synchronize data across many peers. For a deep dive over breakfast, read the Threads Whitepaper . For now, here's a quick tour. The Threads Whitepaper outlines a number of new innovations, some highlights include: Standardized key management for securing data created in your apps An easy interface to create and update models (think MongoDB) A simple way for data owners to invite new members to their database Technically, Each thread contains a store (where data is kept) and models (the data structures you store and update). Threads are collaborative, for one to many users. By default, each thread your app creates for a user is private (fully encrypted) but can then be shared with other users who can then have access to just read or read & write to the same Thread. Data is transferred over IPFS, but it is encrypted by keys only available to people invited to the thread. If you would like to start testing Threads v2 you can use any of the following libraries. Name Status Platforms Description Implementations go-threads Threads reference implementation. js-threads Work in Progress. JavaScript implementation. Clients js-threads-client A JavaScript client for the threads daemon. dart-threads-client A Dart client for the threads daemon. Examples go-foldersync An e2e demo to sync data between two golang clients. js-foldersync A demo of writing and reading models with the js-threads-client. Planned andoroid-threads-client An Android client for the threads daemon. ios-threads-client An iOS client for the threads daemon. Hosted Threads \u00b6 The easiest way to get started with Threads is through Textile's hosted service. In this case, Threads can leverage your team's Textile resources (buckets, pinning, and networking). First, you'll need to create a Textile app token using the textile CLI. Create an app token \u00b6 App tokens allow you to access Textile resources from within apps you build. You can create new app tokens in your project in just a few seconds. textile project tokens add > Selected ethden > Success! Added new token <your new token> Use the token in your app \u00b6 To use your token with your app, simply follow the instructions available in either of the Textile client libraries here (support for other languages and platfirms coming soon!): js-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-threads-client in your app. Voila, now you have an app running a Threads database over IPFS with Textile ensuring that database content is pinned to the network no matter when or if your users remain online. App example \u00b6 The best way to learn how to use Threads is by checkout out our todo list and folder sync example apps. Local debugging \u00b6 The preceding instructions have you set up to use Textile's hosted Threads server. Sometimes when developing with Threads, it can be helpful to use a local Threads server called threadsd instead. You can connect an app using any of the Threads client libraries to the local threadsd , and then use the threads shell to view models, data, and watch events as they change data in real-time. Install the daemon and shell \u00b6 Visit the threads releases page. https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/releases Download the latest release for your platform, Linux, Windows, or Mac (darwin). Install threadsd and threads (or the .exe s on Windows) application. Run the threadsd application without any parameters. tar -xzvf go-threads_v0.1.9_darwin-amd64.tar.gz x install-threads/ x install-threads/install x install-threads/threadsd x install-threads/LICENSE x install-threads/README.md x install-threads/threads cd install-threads/ ./install Moved ./threads to /usr/local/bin Moved ./threadsd to /usr/local/bin threadsd Welcome to Threads! Your peer ID is 12D3KooWFFCiJt6B8Dog9ECpt7KGfqxjUxNktzpTK4e4mzQ51WPG Note for MacOS: By default, MacOS will prevent threadsd from running. After trying and failing once, you'll have to visit System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, choose to allow threadsd to run, and then run threadsd again. Update your project to use local daemon \u00b6 Updating your project to use the locally running threadsd is as simple as setting the dev flag in the Textile.API constructor. Here's an example in Javascript: import { API } from '@textile/textile' import { Client } from '@textile/threads-client' const api = new API ({ token : \"<textile project token>\" , deviceId : \"<user id>\" , dev : true // causes the below client to use the local threadsd }) await api . start () const threadsClient = new Client ( api . threadsConfig ) Use threads shell to monitor data updates \u00b6 Start up the threads shell which will connect to your local threadsd : threads Successfully connected. >>> You first need to specify a store id to operate on using the use command: >>> use <store id> Switched to <store id> >>> Note: You can find your store id by logging it or setting a breakpoint in your app when you create a Theads store. Another note: In reality, you'll want to keep track of store ids you app creates so you can access those stores at a later time. View all updates to the data in the current store using the listen command: >>> listen <enter> to cancel { \"ID\" : \"5389d030-22b4-4327-aed5-10ae1f1f14d8\" , \"files\" : [] , \"owner\" : \"myFolder\" } { \"ID\" : \"5389d030-22b4-4327-aed5-10ae1f1f14d8\" , \"files\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"25ea5bc5-cbef-4619-9380-9725388f873b\" , \"cid\" : \"\" , \"files\" : [] , \"isDirectory\" : false, \"name\" : \"filecoin.pdf\" } ] , \"owner\" : \"myFolder\" } Explore data using the modelFind and modelFindById commands. Filecoin \u00b6 We recently announced our initiative to build developer tools for Filecoin. Those tools will leverage and link into Threads v2 and the Textile CLI to give developers simple ways to leverage Filecoin. You can follow our Filecoin progress here .","title":"A tour of textile"},{"location":"a-tour-of-textile/#introduction","text":"Textile is a set of tools to help you and your team build decentralized apps, fast.

Textile provides Threads - A decentralized database built on IPFS. Threads give your app a way to store private data for one user or synchronize data across many peers. For a deep dive over breakfast, read the Threads Whitepaper . For now, here's a quick tour. The Threads Whitepaper outlines a number of new innovations, some highlights include: Standardized key management for securing data created in your apps An easy interface to create and update models (think MongoDB) A simple way for data owners to invite new members to their database Technically, Each thread contains a store (where data is kept) and models (the data structures you store and update). Threads are collaborative, for one to many users. By default, each thread your app creates for a user is private (fully encrypted) but can then be shared with other users who can then have access to just read or read & write to the same Thread. Data is transferred over IPFS, but it is encrypted by keys only available to people invited to the thread. If you would like to start testing Threads v2 you can use any of the following libraries.

Unlike traditional cloud services, Buckets are built on open, decentralized protocols including the IPFS and Libp2p. You can serve websites, data, and apps from Buckets. Buckets are packed with useful features, including: Explore your Buckets on the Hub gateway . Render web content in your Bucket on a persistent website . Automatically distribute your updates on IPFS using IPNS . Collaboratively manage Buckets as an organization . Create private Buckets where your app users can store data . Initialize a Bucket \u00b6 When working on your local machine, Buckets are mapped to working directories. Once you initialize a Bucket in a directory, anytime you return to the directory, the Textile CLI will automatically detect the Bucket you are interacting with. To start a Bucket in your current working directory, you must first initialize the Bucket. Read CLI docs for Buckets . Shared Buckets \u00b6 You can create Buckets to share with all members of an organization. To do so, simply initialize an Org first and then initialize a Bucket using the --org flag, specifying the name of the Org you want to share the bucket with. All members of the Org will be able to push and pull files to and from the shared Bucket. Read more about creating Orgs . Publishing content \u00b6 Push new files \u00b6 View the Bucket push CLI docs . tt bucket push site/ . Retrieving content \u00b6 Pull files \u00b6 tt bucket init --existing By using the --existing flag, you can list Buckets already pushed by you or, when using --org , your collaborators. Explore on the gateway \u00b6 The Hub gateway gives you a static URL where you can explore, download, and share your latest Bucket content. Render on a website \u00b6 If your Bucket contains web content, the Bucket website endpoint will provide you a static URL that will always render the latest content from your Bucket. Render on IPFS gateways \u00b6 Buckets are dynamic folders distributed over IPFS using ThreadsDB. Each Bucket has a unique IPNS address that will allow you to render or fetch your Bucket on any IPFS peer or gateway that supports IPNS (including ipfs.io and Cloudflare ). Buckets can't change the speed that IPNS propogates through the network, but we recommend you explore and try for yourself. The Hub gateway will always render the latest data right away. Buckets CLI \u00b6 Visit Textile Hub CLI docs for Buckets . Learn more about Buckets \u00b6 Bucket Permissions \u00b6 Developer Buckets \u00b6 All Buckets you create are scoped to your developer account. You can always find your currently logged in account with tt whoami . Organization Buckets \u00b6 Any Buckets you create using the --org flag will also be shared with Org members. Here are the steps to create Org, create a new Bucket in the Org, and invite a collaborator to the Org: Create a new Org \u00b6 tt org create Choose an Org name: nasa\u2588 > The name of your account on Textile will be nasa > Your URL will be http://hub.textile.io/nasa Please confirm: y\u2588 > Success! Created new org nasa with URL http://hub.textile.io/nasa You have now created the nasa Org. Create a new Bucket shared with an Org \u00b6 mkdir launchpad cd launchpad tt bucket init --org nasa You have now created a new Bucket inside of the launchpad directory and owned by your nasa organization. Invite a collaborator \u00b6 tt org invite The final step is to invite collaborators to your Org. Once they accept the invite, they will be able to interact with Buckets associated with the Org. App user Buckets \u00b6 If you are building an app using one of our developer libraries you can use Buckets from inside yoru apps. Apps generally will create Buckets on behalf of each user, meaning the user should retain control of the Bucket metadata and contents. JS Textile Docs Create user Buckets in your JS app. 3Box example See how to use 3Box identities to own Threads and Buckets. Bucket Protocols \u00b6 Buckets are designed to be interoperable across protocols and services. Here are a few examples. Buckets and Threads \u00b6 Buckets are built on ThreadsDB . In fact, in their most basic form, Buckets are just a document in a Thread that is updated each time the directory of data is updated. Since Buckets run on Threads, it opens the door to many new integrations that can be built on Buckets! Buckets and HTTP \u00b6 Buckets can be rendered over HTTP through either the Hub Gateway , the Bucket subdomains , or on any IPFS gateway supporting IPNS (see below). Buckets and IPFS \u00b6 Data in a Bucket is stored as IPLD and pinned on IPFS. You can use the underlying content addresses to pin new Bucket content on additional pinning services such as Pinata or Infura . This can be useful if you want additinal replication of your content on the IPFS network. Buckets and IPNS \u00b6 Every Bucket you create has a unique ID associated with it. The Bucket ID is an IPNS address that you can also use to fetch the latest Bucket content from any IFPS peer or view it over IPFS gateways that support the IPNS protocol.

The Hub makes it simple to manage and update Buckets on IPFS, persist data for your users on IPFS, deploy and scale Threads databases for your app users, and collaborate on all of it with your team! Getting Started \u00b6 The Hub is API driven and available through the command-line tool and developer libraries. To use the Hub, first you need to download the command-line interface and create an account. Textile Hub Accounts Download the CLI and create your free Hub account. Once you have your Hub account, you can start using the Hub to host your data on the IPFS network. IPFS hosting is offered using a Textile technology called, Buckets. Buckets offer you dynamic, folder-based, directories that you can use to persist data on IPFS. They are editable, sharable, and come with free URLs. Buckets Learn how to create, manage, share, and publish data on IPFS. Another thing you can do with your account on the Hub, is create an app token that will allow you to use the Hub for persisting user Thread data. Think of it as a trustless service that your app's database can rely on to keep data on IPFS fast! Thread Services Persist and relay Thread updates for your app users.

We cannot decrypt or otherwise access the data you privately store or share with your contacts. You can choose to share your data such as photos in public forums whereby anyone can view the data contents. Textile provides remote data storage for users on the IPFS network (see https://ipfs.io/ ). The IPFS protocol has no mechanisms for deletion of data once added, so instead, we allow users to 'revoke' their data, such that all servers in the IPFS network run through Textile (including those in the mobile app) will discontinue the hosting and displaying of said data. When you share photos in group forums (\"Threads\"), the encryption keys for the data (full resolution photo, lower resolution copies, and basic metadata) are shared with Thread members and are visible to anyone with the keys to that Thread. Keys are distributed whenever you, or another Thread member, invite new members to the Thread. The encrypted data shared in Threads are distributed over a network of voluntary IPFS servers that no single member, or the Textile organization, controls.

Please read these terms of service (these \u201c Terms \u201d) carefully as they form a contract between you and We Are Set, Inc, a Delaware corporation ( Textile , \u201c we \u201d, \u201c us \u201d, or \u201c our \u201d), that governs your access and use of (i) the web verification and encryption solution software provided by Textile (the \u201c Software \u201d); (ii) the Textile websites at textile.io and textile.photos (the \u201c Site \u201d); and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Textile (the \u201c User Guides \u201d) (collectively the \u201c Service(s) \u201d). By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Textile that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that organization). You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Textile and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES . Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact privacy@textile.io . Please note that Textile does not provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY), 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) and 19 (ARBITRATION) of these Terms for details. 1. ABOUT THE SERVICE \u00b6 The Service offers verification and authentication services and encryption services for users of photos and other personally collected data. The Service provides a private data storage system (\" Storage \") for users to maintain remote copies of their privately encrypted data. Storage is managed on IPFS ( https://www.ipfs.io/ ) nodes running on a user's personal device. The Service allows users to sync encrypted copies of their data privately with other devices. The service also allows users to create groups of multiple people who all use a shared encryption key to post, comment, and interact with encrypted photos and other data shared by group members (\" Sharing \" and \" Threads \"). Copies of data will be cached, on voluntary IPFS peers on the network including peers hosted by Textile, whenever a user shares data in a group Thread. Cached copies of shared data will be encrypted with keys only available to Thread members and so not readable by anyone else on the network. 2. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS \u00b6 We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Site. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). If, in our sole discretion, we deem a revision to these Terms to be material, we will notify you via the Service and/or by email to the email address associated with your account. Notice of other changes may be provided via the Site. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated. Your continued access or use of any portion of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If you don\u2019t agree to any of the changes, we\u2019re not obligated to keep providing the Service to you, and you must cancel and stop using the Service. 3. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE \u00b6 You may use the Service, on a non-exclusive basis, solely in strict compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. 4.

ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER \u00b6 17.1 \u00b6 Introduction. This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. 17.2 \u00b6 Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. 17.3 Arbitration Agreement \u00b6 After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California. 18. NOTICES \u00b6 We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide. We may provide required information to you by email at the address you specified when you signed up for the Service or by access to a website that we identify.

This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.","title":"17.1"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#172","text":"Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.","title":"17.2"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#173-arbitration-agreement","text":"After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California.","title":"17.3 Arbitration Agreement"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#18-notices","text":"We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.

Together, the Threads Protocol and Database provide an alternative architecture for data on the web. ThreadsDB aims to help power a new generation of web technologies by combining a novel use of event sourcing, Interplanetary Linked Data ( IPLD ), and access control to provide a distributed, scalable, and flexible database solution for decentralized applications. Developer API \u00b6 ThreadsDB is designed to be simple enough for any developer to start using. The API will feel familiar to developers who have worked with technologies like MongoDB or Mongoose. The first three concepts a developer will encounter with ThreadsDB are Databases , Collections , and Instances . The organization is simple. Instances are the individual records you create, update, or delete. Instances are stored in a Collection. Collections have one or many Schemas and can only store Instances that match one of those Schemas. Databases can store many Collections. ThreadsDB supports Mongodb/Mongoose style search. In the JavaScript library, you might write queries like the following. Players . find ( { $and : [ { points : { $gt : 10 } }, { points : { $lt : 20 } }, { team : 'Astronauts' } ] }, { sort : { points : - 1 }} ) Multi-user Databases \u00b6 Everything above just looks like a Database, so what's a Thread? ThreadsDB combines the storage and management of data (the Database) with networking, access control, and replication over IPFS using the Threads Protocol. The Threads protocol has been extensively documented in the [whitepaper], but in short, Threads use private-key encryption to manage both security and identity among multiple parties that can access or edit the same Database. Jump to Thread Networking to read more. Replication with the Hub \u00b6 ThreadsDB has been designed to support trustless peers on the network to provide services that improve or enhance performance and experience for end-users. The Hub offers Thread Services for relay, replication, and backup that you can add for your users in a couple of minutes. Connect to the Hub \u00b6 Create an Account Create an App Token Add the Textile Library to your App ThreadsDB \u00b6 Basic Usage \u00b6 Databases \u00b6 A Thread-based Database is tied to a single Thread (with associated Thread ID). A Database is an Event Emitter (in the Nodejs sense), and Listeners can subscribe to Events using 'wildcard' syntax via the EventEmitter2 library. To start an empty database is simple. import { Database } from '@textile/threads-database' const db = new Database (...) Collections \u00b6 To handle different data structures, a Database contains Collections, each of which are defined by a json-schema.org schema. These schemas define the 'shape' of Collection Instances. Collections implement a Store with JSON Patch semantics by default, but will be made to support other types (CRDT-driven documents for instance) in the future (some of which are already under active development). Ultimately, a Collection is a Store with a set of APIs to make it feel like a local database table . import { Database } from '@textile/threads-database' const db = new Database (...) const Collection = await db . newCollectionFromObject ( 'Players' , { ID : '' , team : '' , name : '' , points : 0 , }) // This will listen to any and all event types on Players db . on ( 'Players.**' , update => { console . log ( update ) }) Instances \u00b6 Instances are the objects you store in your Collection. Instances are JSON documents with schemas that match those defined in your Collection. Creating and manipulating them is simple. const beth = new Collection ({ ID : 'id-i1' , name : 'Beth' }) // This is not yet persisted await beth . save () // Save changes // Modify the `beth` instance beth . points = 1 await beth . save () // Save changes // Modify it again beth . team = 'Astronauts' beth . points = 2 // Save it from the Collection await Collection . save ( i1 ) // Delete it from the Collection await Collection . delete ( i1 . ID ) Query \u00b6 Each Threads implementation supports query and look-up capabilities such as insert , findOne , has , and more. Threads also supports Mongodb/Mongoose style search, find . const Players = new Collection < Player > ( 'players' , {}) // Anything goes schema await Players . insert ( { ID : '' , points : 11 , team : 'Astronauts' : name : 'beth' }, { ID : '' , points : 1 , team : 'Astronauts' : name : 'jim' }, { ID : '' , points : 18 , team : 'Astronauts' : name : 'issac' }, { ID : '' , points : 7 , team : 'Astronauts' : name : 'beth' }, ) const all = Players . find ({ $or : [{ points : { $gt : 10 } }, { name : 'jim' }] }, { sort : { points : - 1 } }) for await ( const { key , value } of all ) { console . log ( value ) } Transactions \u00b6 Collections support (basic) read and write Transactions. These are lockable, key-based 'states' that you can put the Collection into, so that anything else that wants to write to the Collection must await for the Transaction to complete. Transactions do not yet provide isolation, though they do provide atomic update semantics. Subscriptions \u00b6 Subscriptions can be created on the different forms of updates on a Collection (CREATE, SAVE, DELETE, ALL). These events will trigger for both local changes and changes that occur from network based peers with access to the Database. Networking \u00b6 Multiuser Threads \u00b6 The following end-to-end example of exchanging data between two peers provides a good idea of the APIs that developers can use to connect multiple users to the same database. Behind the scenes, ThreadsDB uses a combination of protocols to help connect and syncronize users on the network under most conditions. import { Multiaddr , ThreadID , Variant } from '@textile/threads-core' import { Database } from '@textile/threads-database' import { DomainDatastore } from '@textile/threads-store' import { MemoryDatastore , Key } from 'interface-datastore' import LevelDatastore from 'datastore-level' interface DummyEntity { ID : string name : string counter : number } // Peer 1: Create db1, register a collection, create and update an instance. const d1 = new Database (...) await d1 . open () const id1 = d1 . threadID if ( id1 === undefined ) { throw new Error ( 'should not be invalid thread id' ) } // Create a new collection const Dummy1 = await d1 . newCollectionFromObject < DummyEntity > ( 'dummy' , { ID : '' , name : '' , counter : 0 , }) // Get peer1 database information (addr, id, keys, etc) const dbInfo = await d1 . dbInfo () // Peer 2: Create a completely parallel db2, which will sync with the previous one and should // have the same state of dummy. This one will be manually 'built' from sub-components, // just to show how it can be done! const info = await d1 . service . getThread ( id1 ) const datastore = new MemoryDatastore () const client = new Client ({ host : 'http://127.0.0.1:6207' }) const service = new Network ( new DomainDatastore ( datastore , new Key ( 'service' )), client ) const test = await service . getHostID () const d2 = await Database . fromAddress ( dbInfo . addr , info . key , datastore , { service , }) // Create parallel collection const Dummy2 = await d2 . newCollectionFromObject < DummyEntity > ( 'dummy' , { ID : '' , name : '' , counter : 0 , }) const dummy1 = new Dummy1 ({ name : 'Textile' , counter : 0 }) dummy1 . counter += 42 await dummy1 . save () // wait about 5 seconds? const dummy2 = await Dummy2 . findById ( dummy1 . ID ) console . log ( dummy2 . name === dummy1 . name ) console . log ( dummy2 . counter === dummy1 . counter ) await d1 . close () await d2 . close () That's it! Two completely separate database instances, syncing encrypted and signed data across the network! Access-control \u00b6 ThreadsDB has a modular ACL system that will allow ACLs to be declared in a wide-variety of ways. ACLs are in active development and you can follow the development here . Identity \u00b6 ThreadsDB allows you to handle user identities in the best way for your app and your users. We include examples here that use private-key identities from Libp2p as well as 3Box identities. Pinning, Relay, and Replication \u00b6 Thread Services (e.g. pinning encrypted data on IPFS and helping multiple peers relay updates across the network) can be built and deployed to the network using go-threads . Textile offers a number of these functions through the Hub. Attaching the Hub to your databases will allow you to deliver a high-quality user-experience. See more Local Daemon \u00b6 The Threads Daemon may be helpful to developers that aim to build their own Thread services, host replication services, or test advanced Thread usage. The Threads Daemon ( threadsd ) is provided as an installable binary with every release of Threads . Installation \u00b6 ThreadsDB can be used from many different languages and has libraries written in Javascript, Go, and Dart. Find documentatin on each of those Libraries below. JavaScript Add Threads to NodeJS, React Native or browser apps. Golang Use Threads in Go or compile to many other platforms. Dart Use a lightweight client library in Dart and Flutter. Advanced Details \u00b6 The protocols and design of ThreadsDB can be explored in detail in the whitepaper: A protocol & event-sourced database for decentralized user-siloed data .
