								13.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim, or controversy
								("Claim") relating in any way to this Agreement, the Textile
								Site, your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or
								services sold or distributed by Textile will be resolved by
								binding arbitration as provided in this Section 13, rather than
								in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims
								court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and
								federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no
								judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
								award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
								individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
								(including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory
								damages) and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court
								would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the
								expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive
								Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "Rules") as those Rules
								exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules
								16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be
								final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may
								be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
								Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided
								herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator's
								award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District
								Court or a California state court located in San Francisco
								County, California. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state,
								or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
								dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
								unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation
								of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of
								the Agreement is void or voidable. If a claim proceeds in court
								for any reason rather than in arbitration, we and you waive any
								right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we and you
								both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin
								infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
							</p>
							<p>
								13.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
								CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS
								A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
								REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT
								TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless
								both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate
								more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form
								of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may
								award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
								seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
								relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court
								decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this
								paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief,
								then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the
								arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or
								arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in
								this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that
								an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the
								arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and
								void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not
								agreed to arbitrate disputes.
							</p>
							<p>
								13.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and
								not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver
								provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your
