Textile provides exchange and storage of data. Textile provides remote data storage for users on the IPFS network (see https://ipfs.io/). The IPFS protocol has no mechanisms for deletion of data hosted on multiple providers on the network. When a Textile user 'deletes' data, we will remove that data from all servers in the IPFS network run by Textile.
