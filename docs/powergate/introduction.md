# Introduction to the Powergate

The Powergate is an API driven solution for deploying multitiered storage across Filecoin and IPFS. Persistent storage on Filecoin allows rich storage configuration for data such as replication factor, miner selection, deal renewal, and repair. Network available storage is configurable and provided through a connected IPFS peer or pinning network.

The Powergate allows you to do magical things with Filecoin. Look out for updates soon! For now, follow the project [on our blog](https://blog.textile.io/tag/filecoin/) and on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) and give us your feedback.
