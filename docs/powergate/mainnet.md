# Filecoin Mainnet

If you are ready to run on Mainnet, the Powergate should make it as easy as possible. Note that running a fully synced [Lotus](https://lotu.sh/) node can take a considerable amount of time and resources. The required effort is normal on live blockchain networks. It may take more than a day to properly sync the current chain the first time your run the Powergate.

## Getting Started

There are a few resources you'll need before you start running any nodes.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). In the examples below, you'll run node instances using local Docker containers. You can do the same with any Docker enabled system, but to get started we recommend Docker Desktop and the default configurations we provide.
- [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate).
- - [Golang](https://golang.org/). Building the Powergate CLI from code requires that you can run commands with Go. Other sections of the tutorials below don't have any Go requirement.

## Mainnet with Powergate

### Installation

Clone the Powergate and `cd` into the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:textileio/powergate.git
cd powergate
```

### Setup

A default setup is available in a `docker-compose` configuration shipped with the Powergate. With the default setup, you will run Powergate connected to live Filecoin Mainnet.

**Run the docker-compose**

Docker files for the Powergate are all contained in the folder, `/docker`.

```bash
cd docker
make up
```

If this is your first time running the Powergate, Docker will download the required instances before any Powergate setup begins. Downloads are dependent on your bandwidth and may take **a few minutes**, but won't be required for subsequent runs of the Powergate.

If this is the first time you are running the Powergate on the mainnet, or if you have been offline for any amount of time, you will need to wait for the chain to properly sync. This will likely take more than a day.

Once running, you will begin to see log outputs.

```bash
lotus_1      | 2020-05-29T20:35:08.644Z	WARN	miner	miner/miner.go:177\
mined block in the past	{"block-time": "2009-01-01T04:44:30.000Z",\
"time": "2020-05-29T20:35:08.644Z", "duration": 359999438.64444387}
```

When complete, you will have a fully functional Powergate (`powd`), a Lotus node, and an IPFS node wired correctly together to start using the Mainnet!

### Bootstrap a clean Lotus node from a snapshot

Syncing a new Lotus node from genesis can take a considerable time. The current `mainnet` network is providing snapshots of the VM state every hour, which in the worst case means having to sync less than 250 blocks from the tip of the chain.

Bootstraping the Lotus node from a snapshot implies complete trust in the party who generated it. This is a pragmatic solution for getting up to speed fast. Depending on your use case you should consider the security risks of accepting snapshots from trusted parties. The snapshot described in this section is generated by Protocol Labs, founders of Filecoin.

To boostrap a clean Lotus node from a `mainnet` snapshot, you should edit the `docker/docker-compose.yaml` in the following way:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136245/99153057-c3f3b780-2684-11eb-9f78-c74e883a74ea.png)

After doing that, you should run `make up`. If you inspect the Lotus node with `docker logs mainnet_lotus_1`, you'll see messages describing that a snapshot is being imported with other Badger compaction interleaved messages. After the importing is done the Lotus node will continue to sync as usual showing the typical logs. At this point you should `make down` (you don't need to wait to full syncing), revert or comment the added line in `docker/docker-compose.yaml`, and `make up` again.

Congratulations! You're now syncing from a trusted checkpoint.


### Recover or prune your existing Lotus node with a snapshot

If you run a Lotus node for a long time its underlying `chain` datastore will become bigger which starts affecting the syncing process and possibly producing other problems. Also, if for some reason your node falls behind syncing and stays far away from the tip, is sometimes faster to re-import a snapshot again than waiting for the syncing process to catch up.

In any case, you should perform the following steps:
1. Execute `make down` to shutdown your Lotus node.
2. Execute `docker run --rm -v mainnet_powergate-lotus:/data ubuntu rm -rf /data/.lotus/datastore/chain`
3. Execute the steps described in _Boostrap a clean Lotus node from a snapshot_.

What is done here is **only** deleting chain data and *not* your wallet addresses and other important metadata information.

### Create a deal and store a file

Now that your Powergate is running on mainnet, all the CLI and API commands are the same as if you had run it on localnet before.

#### Install the CLI

From the root of the `powergate` repo, you can build the CLI from the latest code. This will install the Powergate CLI, `pow`, on your machine.

```bash
make build
```

Test your installation.

```bash
pow --help
```

#### Start storing data

You are now ready to start storing and retrieving data using the Powergate. Read more on [Storing Data with the FFS](ffs.md).
