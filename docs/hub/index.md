The Hub is the fastest way to start building and experimenting with Textile technologies. It provides:

* Hosted [Buckets](../buckets/index.md) and [Threads](../threads/index.md) with persistent IPFS endpoints. 
* Developer accounts for individuals and organizations.
* API key integration into apps.

!!! Warning
    The Hub is built on a handful of experimental protocols, many are still in Beta. Please [report any issues you experience](https://github.com/textileio/textile/issues).

## Security

Textile is still under heavy development and no part of it should be used before a thorough review of the underlying code.

APIs and protocols may change rapidly. 

There may be coding mistakes, and the underlying protocols may contain design flaws. 

*Please [let us know immediately](https://github.com/textileio/textile/issues) if you have discovered a security vulnerability.*

Please also read the [security note](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#security-issues) for go-ipfs.

## Available commands

To get started, you'll be using the Hub client. The layout of the Hub CLI mirrors the services available, for example:

* `hub threads` provide limited access to ThreadDB.
* `hub buck` provides access to Buckets.
* `hub keys` create and expire API keys.
* `hub orgs` lets you create multi-developer organizations for collaboration.

Once you've [set up an account](/hub/accounts) on the Hub, you can start accessing those resources right away. 

Additionally, you can use the API keys to grant restricted access to your Hub resources to the end-users of your apps and services.

## Roles

### Developers
Developers are the primary account owner. Using the CLI, developers can:

* Create new API keys.
* Create and join new Organizations and access admin APIs.
* Create your own Buckets and Threads.

### Organizations
You and your collaborators. Members can:

* Share admin control of API keys.
* Share access to and synchronize Bucket state across all members.
* Referenced through docs as simply, `Org`.

### Users
Accounts generated by your app using a `User Group` API key.

* Your app can create Threads and Buckets owned by these users.
* Users can then add or remove content from those assets based on their identity.
* Users *cannot* use the CLI and *cannot* create new API keys.

## Next steps

### Install & Create Account

The Hub is API driven and available through the command-line tool and developer libraries. To use the Hub, you need to download the command-line interface and create an account.
