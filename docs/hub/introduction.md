The Hub is a portal where teams and individual developers can access IPFS and *soon* Filecoin resources easily. Hub users can create storage buckets to persist data on the IPFS network, design and launch new Threads databases into apps, and collaborate with team members with shared access control. 

## Getting Started

The Hub is API driven and available through the command-line tool and developer libraries. To use the Hub, first you need to download the command-line interface and create an account.

<div class="txtl-options center">
  <a href="/hub/accounts" class="box">
    <h5>Hub Accounts</h5>
    <p>Download the CLI and create your free Hub account.</p>
  </a>
</div>

Once you have your Hub account, you can start using the Hub to host your data on the IPFS network. IPFS hosting is offered using a Textile technology called, Buckets. Buckets offer you dynamic, folder-based, directories that you can use to persist data on IPFS. They are editable, sharable, and come with free URLs. 

<div class="txtl-options center">
  <a href="/hub/bucket-hosting" class="box">
    <h5>Bucket Hosting</h5>
    <p>Learn how to create, manage, share, and publish data on IPFS.</p>
  </a>
</div>

Another thing you can do with your account on the Hub, is create an app token that will allow you to use the Hub for persisting user Thread data. Think of it as a trustless service that your app's database can rely on to keep data on IPFS fast!

<div class="txtl-options center">
  <a href="/hub/thread-services" class="box">
    <h5>Thread Services</h5>
    <p>Persist and relay Thread updates for your app users.</p>
  </a>
</div>
