[Textile](https://github.com/textileio) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

![The network](/images/home.png)

We believe that future technology can be built around a new model of data ownership where individuals have total agency over the information they create.

Textile aims to standardize the use of _secure, cross-application user-owed data storage and sharing_ by providing a set of easy-to-use developer tools and UX primitives. Let's build technology that can be loved while not worrying about censorship and privacy.

With Textile, you can use or build applications...

* where users are able to utilize their data across applications and devices.
* where users are able to leverage their own storage backend.
* that run on mobile, web, and desktop.
* that can traverse the IPFS network on any device.
* by designing data structures (schemas) for user and app data, which can control encoding and encryption, and can also be parsed by other applications (programmability).

## What can you do with it?

### Developers

* Build decentralized storage and sharing applications. See [Textile Photos](https://github.com/textileio/textile-mobile).
* Build better ways for users to manage their private information. See [AirSecure](https://github.com/airsecure/airsecure).
* Build chat apps, website publishing services, health apps, family tools, and more. Got an idea, [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/).

### Everyone

* Choose or federate your own backup and service peer ([cafes](/concepts/cafes)) and still participate in the whole network.
