[Textile](https://github.com/textileio) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

![The network](/images/home.png){: .center}

We believe that future technology can be built around a new model of data ownership where individuals have total agency over the information they create.

## What can you do with it?

### Developers

* Build decentralized storage and sharing applications. See [Textile Photos](https://github.com/textileio/photos).
* Build better ways for users to manage their private information. See [AirSecure](https://github.com/airsecure/airsecure).
* Build chat apps, website publishing services, health apps, family tools, and more. Got an idea, [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/).

### Everyone

* Choose or federate your own backup and service peer ([cafes](/concepts/cafes)) and still participate in the whole network.
