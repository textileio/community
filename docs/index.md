# What is Textile?

[Textile](https://github.com/textileio) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

We believe that future technology can be built around a new model of data ownership where individuals have total agency over the information they create.

Textile aims to standardize the use of _secure, cross-application user-owed data storage and communication_ by providing a set of easy-to-use developer tools and UX primitives. Let's build technology that can be loved while not worrying about censorship and privacy.

With Textile, you can use or build applications...

* where users are able to utilize their data across applications and devices.
* where users are able to leverage their own storage backend.
* that run on mobile, web, and desktop.
* that can traverse the IPFS network on any device.
* by designing data structures (schemas) for user and app data, which can control encoding and encryption, and are also understandable by other applications (programmability).

## What can you do with it?

### Developers

* Build decentralized storage and sharing applications. See [Textile Photos](https://github.com/textileio/textile-mobile).
* Build better ways for users to manage their private information. See [AirSecure](https://github.com/airsecure/airsecure).
* Build chat apps, website publishing services, health apps, family tools, and more. Got an idea, [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/).

### Everyone

* Choose or federate your own backup and service peer ([cafes](/learn/cafes)) and still participate in the whole network.

## Try it!

### Run an account peer

You can create an account and run a peer in no time.

- Get the [desktop](/run/desktop) tray app
- Run the command-line [daemon](/run/daemon)
- Install a [mobile app](/#apps) that contains a client SDK

### Run a cafe peer

Cafes are easy to deploy & manage (single executable, Docker).

- Setup your own cafe [here](/run/cafe)

## Build with a client SDK

- Check out the [client SDKs](/clients)

## Textile libraries and apps

The underlying Textile libraries and tools are already being used in production. SDKs, APIs, and apps are available for most major platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, Windows, etc), with more being developed on a regular basis. Feel free to poke around the various projects below to get a feel for what Textile is working on. Interested in building on top of the Textile platform? [Get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/)!
