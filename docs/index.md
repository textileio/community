[Textile](https://github.com/textileio) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as **an open and programmable iCloud**.

We believe that future technology can be built around a new model of data ownership where individuals have total agency over the information they create.
